Throughout this book I shall use a simple graphical system to illustrate the three questions. I shall use circles to identify weaknesses and dotted circles to identify potential weaknesses. I shall use squares to identify the worst-placed pieces and dotted squares to identify pieces that might have problems later on. Finally, I shall use arrows to illustrate the opponent's ideas and dotted lines to illustrate potential ideas that may lie far into the future. Let us look at an example. The circles indicate that c3 and g5 are immediate weaknesses, while it is easy to believe that the f6-square and the king will be weak later on (hence the dotted circles) . White's worst-placed piece is the bishop on g2, but because this is not especially relevant here, I have chosen not to give it a square. Black's pieces are all fighting for the "honour" of being worst-placed, so again I have chosen not to give a square to one (or all) of them, as it would just be confusing. Finally, Black's idea in this position definitely has to be ...h6 to protect his biggest weakness; hence the arrow. Obviously he has other ideas in the position - 99.9% of all positions will contain a multitude of ideas -but what we are looking for is the idea, the one that we should take most seriously. In fact, Black would have a decent position with reasonable compensation for the exchange if he had time to play a couple of useful moves, ...♘c4 and ...h6. The latter can be prevented with a nice little move: 32.h6! Axh6 Black cannot live with the white pawn placed here. 33.Dh5 Ag7 34.Dxg5 Cc6 35.Cg4 White won on move 80 after various adventures on the way. Line

The pawn on d4 is weak and the pawns on b2 and c5 are potential weaknesses later on. White is intending ♘c3-e4-d6. Black's worst piece by far is the bishop on c8 (and White's the knight on b1). All of this inspires Black to strike at the main weakness with a pawn sacrifice that opens up the position before White has managed to get his pieces out. From looking passive and about to be behind in development, Black becomes very active and solves the problems with his pawn structure that were making the c8-bishop bad. The pawn will be regained soon enough. 18...e5! 19.d5 [19.dxe5 De7 20.f4 (20.Cc3 is possibly better, but Black has solved all his problems and should be looking for a way to play for an advantage.) 20...Td8 and it is hard for White to make progress.] 19...f5 [Stronger is 19...cxd5 followed by ...♕e7, when White would find the both c5-pawn and the b2-pawn to be unpleasantly weak.] 20.dxc6 e4 21.cxb7 Axb7 22.c6 Aa6 23.Db3 Passive play is not a good idea in a position like this, where your opponent seems to be holding all the trumps.

The c5-pawn is a serious weakness in the black position, and after 35.Ae3! Black was in trouble. The pawns on a7, c6, f5 and h7 are also a bit weak, but in reality they are much harder to attack and therefore of less importance. And that is what is important about weaknesses - the ease or difficulty of defending them in the short term and in the long term. Line

If White now had played 29.f3! he would have left Black with great problems and more or less no counterplay; the g3-pawn is slightly weakened, but this is in the long term as there is no quick way to get to it. Instead he weakened the f3-square (as well as the d3- pawn) in his efforts to defend f2, giving Black the counterplay necessary to survive. Moving the f-pawn might at first feel a bit artificial, but once you start looking at it seriously, it becomes very attractive. Therefore I suspect that Peter did not seriously look at this non-standard move. If he had, he probably would have played it. Chess is like that sometimes, you decide to save time for later decisions (unless you have already spent it on prior ones) , not suspecting that this was the right moment. Getting better at understanding when we have to make a serious choice is one of the most elusive, but at the same time most important, skills for a strong chess player to develop.[Squares We have already touched a little on weakened squares with the above example. The main difference between weak pawns and weak squares (looking beyond the price tag here) is probably that weakened pawns are generally static in nature, while weakened squares usually create dynamic possibilities. This is well illustrated in the following example: White has succeeded greatly on the queenside, while Black has not established more than a threat to f2 on the kingside. 29.e4? Df3! There is an immediate threat to the d3-pawn. 30.Ae1 (After 30.Dd2?! Black has a fantastic idea: 30...Tf7!! Black's idea is either ...♘f8-e6-g5 with a strong attack, or taking twice on b6 and playing ...♖d7.(Instead, 30...Cxb6 31.Taxb6 Txb6 32.Txb6 Td8 33.Tb7! offers White enough counterplay to draw, although even this might have been disappointing for him after being so much better.) ) 30...Cxb6 31.Tbxb6 Txb6 32.Txb6? It was essential to force the exchange of rooks in order to survive. (32.Dxb6 Tf6 33.Da7 Txa6 34.Dxa6 Dxd3 35.Db5 would have been the right way to play, as after 35...Dxe4 36.Ad2 White can still hold the balance. We could look at this conceptually and say that the f2-pawn and the white king are only weak if the rooks remain on the board. Without them the white bishop has more potential and White will make the draw. But this is rationalizing after the face; something that is really useful to do when we analyse games - to develop our understanding/intuition - but not of much help when you have a few minutes to choose between two seemingly unattractive options.) 32...Dxd3 33.Tb7?! (A better chance to defend would have been 33.Db1 Dxc4 34.Tb7 but once things scare going against you, it is very hard to find the best chances.) 33...Dxe4 Black is in full control. He won on move 55.]  Line

White has no advantage whatsoever. The weakness of the d6-pawn is not detrimental and is easily balanced by the possibility of counterplay with ...d5 and down the c-file. On the other hand, White has no reason to be worse either. He is fairly active and Black has no obvious way to bring his knight to c3. There is one other defect in the black position, the advanced h-pawn. This has the advantage of providing the king with an escape route, in the event of a revolt, but has at the same time weakened the foundations of his castle. In the game, White was successful in exploiting this in classic style. 28.g4! De5 29.Cb5 Tac6 30.Tc1 Tb8?! This seems a bit planless; Black is not realistically going to sacrifice on b5. Shengelia was probably looking for a way to complicate matters, in order to outplay his lower-rated opponent. [30...d5 was sensible. Black is not worse.] 31.h4 White takes a serious step forward towards exploiting the h6-hook. We can now see that the pawn would have been better on h7 as things have turned out. As always, the problem is not that Black played ...h6 once upon a time, but that he did not meet the challenges that followed from there. 31...Dg3 32.Td3 Tbb6?! [This is a bit artificial. Better was 32...Ce8 when Black can consider taking the h4-pawn, if allowed.] 33.g5 Cd7 Relying on ...♘e5 to come and save the day, but White avoids this easily.

The following example is also quite standard for how to exploit a weakened pawn structure. The g6-pawn is a hook, but it is also a slightly weakened point. Black's kingside has been slightly weakened by the exchange of his h-pawn for the white e-pawn. After the advance of the white h-pawn, Black will have significant problems with his structure, which would not be the case if the pawn was still on g7. 29.h4! Te7 [29...Ag7 30.Cg5 f5 31.Ac2] 30.h5 Af5 [30...Txa7 31.Txa7 Db6 32.Ta1 Af5 33.Dc2] 31.Dc2 Dc8 32.hxg6 fxg6 33.Cd2 Rf8?! Black is aiming to get the badly-placed bishop to the  c5-square, where it would help the position somewhat. White is still better,  but Black can resist quite a lot. I would guess that Giorgadze failed to see  this option simply because the idea of leaving the white rook unchallenged on  the 7th rank seemed dangerous. And certainly it is dangerous, but the dangers  connected with doing nothing are considerable too. [Black's last real chance  to save the game came through 33...Txa7 34.Txa7 Ad8!] 34.T7a6! With  this move, White keeps control over the a-file, leaves Black with the  poorly-placed rook on e7 and delays/prevents the bishop on f6 making it to b6  in the (near) future. 34...Dd7 35.Cf1 [35.Axf5!? was perhaps stronger at this  point. Black would have more difficulties defending the pawn on f5 than he  would have on g6. But Adams prefers to keep the control that comes with having  a good knight against a bad bishop.] 35...Tf7 36.Cg3 Ae7 [36...Ah4 is  refuted by 37.Axf5 gxf5 38.Ta7 Dxa7 39.Txa7 Txa7 40.Cxf5 and next the  queen comes in to finish off the weakened black king.; 
36...Axe4 37.Cxe4 Ae7 was probably the best chance, but this is of course quite desperate.] 37.Ta7 Tb7 A final small tactical mistake in a bad position. [37...Dc8 was  necessary. However, White has a great advantage after 38.Dd2 (while it is  even stronger to force matters with 38.Axf5 gxf5 39.Dd1! followed by  ♖1a6 and ♕h5, with a winning attack.) ] 38.Txb7 Dxb7 39.Axf5 gxf5 40.Cxf5 Dxd5 41.Dd2 Dc6 [41...Dxd2 42.Ta8+ Ad8 43.Txd8#] 42.Dh6+ Re8 43.De6 Line

Let's now return to a position from earlier in the chapter. This time around we shall concentrate a bit more on the weak king in the centre (despite the exchange of queens, the king is still unsafe), and the hook that the pawn on f6 represents. Looking at these we can see that there is a much more aggressive continuation: 11.e5!! fxe5 [The computer recommends  that Black should play 11...Axe5 12.Cxe5 fxe5 when after 13.Axc5 it has  no real defence against ♖he1xe5 (or f2-f4xe5 ). Maybe this is Black's best  option, but in that case White's strategy is definitely right!] 12.Ce4 With  the idea of ♗xc5 should Black defend the bishop, which would lead to a quick  deterioration of the black position. 12...Ae7 13.Cxe5 Black is still struggling  desperately with his development. The next moves are likely to be ♖he1 and  ♗f4, after which it will be very difficult for Black to avoid losing  something. Line

King's position we all play for mate; some just do it in a more indirect way than others -Peter Heine Nielsen We have a tendency to focus on static factors when we talk about positional play, but we muse not neglect dynamic factors. The safety of the king is always a factor, and when we talk about weaknesses it would make no sense not to include weaknesses around the king. Take the following example: White is of course unpleasantly pinned on f2, which makes the defence of the g2-square more difficult. In a chaotic position like this, with pins from d4 to g1 and e2 to a2, an X-ray from c8 to g4, and where Black has sacrificed material, it is hard to think about positional factors; but they are still there. In this case the weakest square in the vicinity of the white king is not h2, although that is the least defended square, because we also need to take into account the potential of the attacking pieces. Here only the black queen can reasonably reach h2. On the other hand, all of the black pieces can attack the g2-square, and on top of this the bishop on d4 is tying White down and eliminating the planned defence along the second rank. Black managed to exploit this quite beautifully in the game. 1...Dc6!! The weakness of the g2-square suddenly  becomes very pressing. Black is threatening ...♘e3. [There was actually a  less natural but equally good way of winning the game. 1...Db7!! would  have the same main point and threats, but after 2.Dg5 an additional way to win the game exists: 2...Axf2+ 3.Txf2 Db1+ Black exploits  that the rook on a2 is unprotected.] 2.Dg5 [2.Dxe2 Ch4! with mace on the  way, is the nice point to Black's combination.] 2...Rg7 Although  spectacular, this example was not conceptually challenging in any way. The  next one is a bit more complex. Line

The correct continuation, on the basis of che weaknesses mentioned, would have been: 32.Ac2! [While it may not be realistic to expect White's attack to be successful against the best defence, it is possible to use the weakness of the h7-pawn (only defended by the king, who does not really count) and the long-term weakness of the a7-pawn to create serious threats. In the game White focused exclusively on the queenside and had only a modest advantage: 32.Ac6?! Rh8 33.Dh5 Db4 34.Df5 Cd7 35.De6 Cf6 36.Td8 h6 37.Txf8+ Dxf8 38.Dd6 Df7 39.Td2 Te7 40.Dd8+ Rh7 41.Dd3+; 
32.Ab1?! is a weaker version of this idea, as there will be checks on e1 to look out for, as well as the knight coming to c3. The bishop is simply not well placed here.; 
32.h3] 32...De8 An undesirable move, [This would have created the strong threat of 32...-- 33.Dc4+ Rh8 34.Dh4 h6 35.Td8 White is winning on account of 35...Tc8 36.Txf8+ Txf8 37.De7! Dc8 38.Td6! and there is no defence against ♖xh6.; 
but unfortunately also the only move. 32...Cb7 33.Td7 Txd7 34.Txd7 Cd8 35.De4 Db6+ 36.Rh1 Dc6 37.Dxc6 Cxc6 38.Ae4 Tf6 39.Tc7 and White should win this endgame.] 33.Dxe8 Txe8 34.Td8 White has a clear advantage, for example: 34...Tce7 35.Txe8+ Txe8 36.Td5 Ce4 [36...Tc8 37.Af5 Tc7 38.Td8+ and White wins a pawn.] 37.Td7 So remember to take notice of the weakness of your own and the opponent's king's position.

Creating weaknesses Accountancy - this is what a friend of mine calls a  certain style of chess, one to which he subscribes personally. What he  specifically likes to do is to create and fix weaknesses in his opponents'  positions, manoeuvre around a bit, and eventually win something. We do not  have to play like this of course, but it makes lots of sense to create a  weakness and then exploit it later on. Here are two examples of the creation  of weaknesses. 12...Dd5! This creates a weakness on the dark squares in  the constellation f2/e3/d4. While this is by no means decisive, it still  causes problems that White must pay attention to for a long time. 13.f3 Da5 14.Ag2 c5! Black puts extra pressure on the weakened dark squares. 15.dxc5 Cc6 16.0-0 0-0 Black was slightly better and won the game on move 38.  In the next example it is clear that White is better, but he can improve his  position considerably by weakening the opponent's structure. Line

White has a fine position with a good knight against a very bad bishop, though it is not obvious that this is enough to win. With his next move he provokes a weakening in the black king's position that soon leads to further problems for Black. Although the attack may not be decisive, it will demand much of Black's attention, meaning that he will find it difficult to defend other aspects of his position, such as the queenside. 27.Dd4! [27.Cd4 Tf6 28.Dd2 is less clear.] 27...g6 A painful move to play, but what  else should Black do? [After 27...Ag6 28.Ch4 it is already time to  consider resignation.; 
And after 27...Ae6 28.Te1 Te8 29.a3 Black is in  a bad way.] 28.Dd2 Te8 29.Cd4 Tfe5 The most active move. [After both 29...Th5 30.Tc1; 
and 29...Tf6 30.Tc1 White would be able to put  pressure on the queenside more or less undisturbed.] 30.f4! White is able  to exploit the weakening of the black kingside with this pawn advance. 30...Te4 31.f5 Rh8 [31...Da7 32.Dh6 Txd4 33.fxg6 hxg6 34.Txg6+ and White wins.] 32.Dh6 De7 The only move; [32...Tg8 33.Cf3! and White wins.] 33.Cf3 Df8 34.Dg5 Dg7 35.f6?! This succeeds in the long term, but in the shorter term  it blocks the open files that White is attacking along. [35.fxg6 Axg6 (35...Dxg6 36.Dc1! and White wins material) 36.Dxd5 Dxb2 37.Dxd6 with an  extra pawn was stronger.] 35...Df8 36.Tc1 h6 37.Dd2 g5?

Fixing weaknesses Usually when we talk about fixing weaknesses, it refers to a situation like this: White moves the a-pawn to a5, in order to fix the weakness on b7 and create a long-term issue with the a6-pawn as well. In the following example, the weakness is fixed through constant pressure on it, and then devoured! Black has a weak pawn on e6, but at the moment it seems that it can be protected without any significant concessions. However, the weakness is all the way down the a2- g8 diagonal and White can make use of this by transferring his bishop. As a result, Black will find it very difficult to ever get rid of the weakness. 21.Af1! The bishop is strong at h3, but on c4 it has the potential to be deadly. 21...Td6 [Black could have tried 21...Rh8 22.Ac4 Dd7 23.De3 Te8 which would have solved one big problem. But White would get free rein to advance his pawns on the kingside and probably win the game in a brutal attack.; 
21...a5!? would make some sense, planning to advance his pawns and at the same time kick the white bishop. However, after 22.Ac4 b5 23.Ad3 Tac8 24.Rb1 Black's position has not really been improved by the advance of the pawns on the queenside.] 22.Ac4 Tad8?! [22...f5 was better, but White has a serious advantage anyway.] 23.f5 Txd4 This loses by force, but by this stage probably everything does. [23...b5 would be an attempt to avoid ♕a3 tricks: 24.Ab3 Te8 (24...Txd4 25.Txd4 Txd4 26.Txe6 Rh8 27.Td6 and White wins material) 25.fxe6 Cxe6 26.d5 This break in the centre wins. 26...cxd5 27.Txd5 Tb6 28.Td2 There is no defence against ♖de2 and ♕d5, winning the knight.; 
23...Te8 24.Da3 and White wins.] 24.fxe6 Txd1+ [The "only" move was 24...De7 but here White can win the game with a simple double threat: After 25.Da3 Black loses something.] 25.Txd1 Txd1+ 26.Dxd1 Having a keen sense of weaknesses is important for your development as a player, both before and after you become a grandmaster.[26.Dxd1 Donner resigned, realizing that 26...De7 is met conclusively with: 27.Dd8!!]  Line

This position is of course essentially equal, but quite often equal positions are won with good moves, so it is important to play the best moves for Black. Here the only reason why White should have any problems is that the b2-pawn is a bit weak, and that he has advanced the a-pawn . Were the a-pawn on a2, Black would not have the chance to make the advances he did in the game. 16...Tfb8! The correct rook, as the other rook needs to keep an  eye on the a-pawn . 17.Tae1 [17.c4 will lead to a knight being established  on d5 once Black deflects the c4-pawn. White might have a temporary initiative,  but long term the d5-square will mean that the position is a bit more pleasant  for Black. 17...a6! On the next move comes 18...b5!, and although the position  is not terribly frightening for White, it is certainly not entirely equal.(17...d5?! would be risky. White suddenly has three pieces attacking on the  kingside. After 18.Ce5 De8 19.Tg4! Black has to play non-script moves  such as 19...f6 when the position is simply unclear.) ; 
17.Ce1! as suggested  by Andrew Greet was probably the most prudent move. White manoeuvres the  knight to d3 in order to keep all his pieces covered. In this case White  probably holds equality without too much trouble.] 17...b5 18.axb5 Txb5 19.Da2 a5 20.T4e2 Dc6 21.Da4 Db7 22.Dc4 Cd5 23.Da2 Cf4 24.Td2 Black  eventually won this blitz-game on move 40, but at this point he overlooked the  chance to win the game instantly with either 24...♖g5 or 24...♘xg2!.

White has a pleasant position after various decent moves, but the clearest plan by far is to transfer a knight to the weak e6-square. This is what White did in the game. 21.Cb5! g5 [21...Tfe8 22.Cbd4 Df7 has the  idea of replying to 23.Ce6 with (23.Dxa5!?; or the more restrained 23.b4 in each case with a great advantage.) 23...Cc5! when Black would be  okay, but it can be met with either the greedy] 22.Cbd4 Dg6 23.Ce6 We  could actually stop here. When you play positional chess, you do not have to  be able to see anything beyond transferring the ineffective knight from c3 to  e6. White has many ways to follow up, with some probably better than others,  but it is not something we gain a practical advantage out of determining in  advance. 23...Tf7 24.Dxa5? This move looks very tempting, but it allows Black  to come back into the game with counterplay on the kingside. The correct way  to play was to make the most out of the remaining inactive pieces. [After 24.Tbe1! White's advantage is very clear. It has to be the b1-rook, as it  was under threat from the queen, and so moving the other rook would deny White  the option of doubling on the e-file. If Black plays 24...Cc5 the knight can be  exchanged and then the rook enters the position on e6 with a clear superiority.(And if Black plays 24...g4 White can play 25.hxg4 Dxg4 26.Te4 with  ♖fe1 on the way. The black position is full of weaknesses and White's  dominating pieces will secure her a clear edge in all lines. In the game,  matters were less clear.) ] 24...g4 25.hxg4 Dxg4 26.De1! The queen is  urgently needed on the kingside. [The computer thinks White also can win with 26.b4?! with the idea that 26...Rh8 27.b5 Tg8 28.bxa6 Ad4 29.Ce1 f3 allows White to play 30.Dd2! This is a very complicated line, and an  example of a machine not being able to do a human's job. After 30...Ae5 Black has  enough counterplay and it is White who has to look for a draw: 31.g3 bxa6 32.Cxf3 Dxf3 33.Cd4 Txg3+ 34.fxg3 Dxg3+ 35.Dg2 Axd4+ 36.Rh1 Dh4+ 37.Dh2 De4+; 
26.Db5?! is another computer favourite. It takes a human to discover the  correct riposte: 26...Rh8! 27.Dxb7 Tg8 Black has some counterplay here. The  critical line starts 28.Ch2! (28.Dxa6? Ad4! and White is mated) 28...Dg6 29.Db3 f3! 30.g3 Cc5 31.Cxc5 Ad4 32.Rh1 Axf2 33.g4 Axc5 34.Dc3+ Rh7 35.Tbe1 f2 with chances for both sides.] 26...Rh8? Black  misses her opponent's defensive resource. [26...Cc5! was much better, and  after 27.Cxc5 dxc5 28.b4 cxb4 29.axb4 Tf6 30.De4 Tg6 Black has a lot of  counterplay. I would guess that White is still minimally better with correct  play, but it is definitely easier to play the black position, making the  result rather unpredictable.] 27.Dd1! Tg8 28.Cfg5!

White's weaknesses are h3 and e4. Black can organize an attack on both of these quite easily. The thing to look out for is how to increase the pressure on the white position without giving White any counterplay. 28...Dd7! The obvious first move. White only has one reply. 29.g4 h5! This is the key move. The white pawns are put under increased  pressure as the pawn joins in the attack. [The common mistake here is to  think that Black has a decisive double attack with 29...Dd3?! but actually,  because of the slighdy exposed nature of the rook on d8, White can repulse the  attack with 30.Te3!; 
It should be said that 29...Ce6 would also give  Black a great game.] 30.Ce3 [White can also call in reinforcements from his  own pawn base, but it would weaken the king's position on the second rank,  which can be seen from the line: 30.f3 Dd3! 31.Te3 Dc2+ with a winning  attack.;

18.Ce4! This move is the best  for two reasons, and should thus be relatively easy to find. First of all it  prevents Black from playing 18...e4 and activating the black bishop on f6.  Secondly, it exchanges the knight on c5, giving White the advantage of good  knight against somewhat inactive bishop. There is of course a lot of play in  the position, but this still secures a slight plus. 18...Cxe4 After this  normal-looking move Black is entirely without counterplay. However, it is not  easy to took up something better. [Maybe it was necessary to play 18...Ae7 when White is still happy after 19.g4 but his queen is not nearly as  dominant as in the game.] 19.Dxe4 White is ready for g2-g4-g5 ; Black has  no counterplay. 19...g6 [19...h5 20.Thg1 would give White a strong initiative  on the kingside.] 20.g4 This move does not make a lot of sense to me.

White's centre looks great, but it is not stable. Black can with a few good moves create some attractive squares for his pieces. One of the surprises to some is that Black does not have to worry too much about the safety of his king in this position. The way the white bishops are pointing, they are a danger to no one. The essence of the position is the way White is clinging on to the light squares, only supporting those in the centre with the knight on c3. It is for this reason that Black can undermine the centre. 11...f5! 12.e5? This is very compliant. Black now has three  pieces that are thriving, while the bishop on g7 is not significantly worse  than the bishop on e3, and despite everything has a long-term future. [12.d5! was a natural move. White is fighting for the light squares as well. After 12...fxe4 White can either choose the calm line with 13.dxe6 (or he can try the  more aggressive 13.Cd4!? Cxd5 14.Cxd5 Axd5 15.f5!?

This is an example of opening preparation gone completely wrong. Carlsen must have thought that he was in time to challenge the bind on the black position created by the pawn on d4, before the weakness of the c6- square and the problems with the backward pawn started to emerge. Kramnik must have wanted his knight on d2 to do something. Both his rooks are inactive, but they cannot assist in the fight for c6 easily. So, once again, the solution is to play the piece which is prime for improvement towards the weakness. 17.Cb3! [The computer points out that there is a more tactical solution to the  position. White is also much better after 17.e4!? Cb6 18.Cb3! axb4 19.axb4 based on the following tactical point: 19...Axb4 20.Ta7 Aa8 21.Txa8! Txa8 22.Cc6 and the bishop is lost as well.

Black should not exchange this bishop, after which he  is forced to accept a bad bishop versus good knight position.

The correct move was played by Grebionkin.] 16...De7!? Black gives up a pawn in the hope that he will get some activity. [If Black plays simple chess, such as 16...Axd4 17.Axd4 Ae6 18.e3; 
or 16...Cxd4 17.Axd4 Ac6 18.e3 then White has a clear edge, with a permanent  target on d5. With the exchange of a pair of minor pieces, the activity of the  black position has disappeared.; 
Black could try the sneaky 16...Ae6!? White does not have any clear way to put Black away, but the position after 17.Cxc6 bxc6 18.Txc6 Axb2 19.Dd3 with ideas such as ♖a6, ♖d1 or ♖c5,  is still very uncomfortable for Black.] 17.Txd5 Axd4 [17...Tad8 18.Cxc6 Axc6 19.Txd8 Txd8 20.Dc2 appears to be a pawn up for nothing.] 18.Axd4 Ae6 19.Ac5 Dc7 20.Td2 Da5 21.Axc6 bxc6 22.b4 White should be winning here.  The extra pawn and the brilliant position of the bishop on c5 are enough to  win. It is true that opposite-coloured bishops can be a strong drawing factor,  but in certain positions, such as this one, they can actually make matters  worse. The face that White did not win the game is down to poor technique, or  perhaps simply a bad day. 22...Da6 23.Dc2 Tad8 24.Tfd1 Txd2 25.Txd2 Db7 26.f3 a6 27.Dc3 Db5 28.Rf2 f6 29.a3 Db7 30.Dd3 [30.Td6 is much more natural;  White is just winning.] 30...h6 31.Dd6 Ad5 32.e4 Ae6 33.g4 Dc8 34.Df4 Td8 35.Ad4 Dd7 36.h4 Df7 37.Ac3 Txd2+ 38.Dxd2 Dc7 39.Rg2 c5 Black should  never have been allowed to play this. 40.De3 cxb4 41.axb4 Dc6 42.Rg3 Dc7+ 43.Rg2 Dc6 44.Ad2 Db5 45.Ae1 Dc6 46.g5 hxg5 47.hxg5 f5 48.Ad2 fxe4 49.fxe4 Af5 50.Rf3 Ag6 51.Dd4 Dc8 52.Ac3 Dh3+ 53.Rf2 Dh2+ 54.Re1 Dg3+ 55.Rd1 Dg4+ 56.Rc1 Dxg5+ 57.Ad2 De7 Line

Black has a weakness on d5 and is under pressure on f7. At the same time Black is nor really able to put pressure on e3, where the bad bishop is defending a good pawn, as Suba would say. The main reason for this is of course that Black's minor pieces are rather out of play. White is able to increase his advantage by putting further pressure on the black position and creating an additional weakness. 26.a4! [After both 26.Da3 Te6;

The weakness of the c6-square is the dominant feature of this position. If Black had time to play ...c7-c5 he would be absolutely okay, but by reacting quickly White can condemn him to passivity. 18.Ab5! This is  the best way to exploit the weakness. [The queen is a poorer blockader and  after 18.Dc6 a6! it is not so easy for White to improve his position.  Black will continue with ...♔h8 and ...♖g8 in order to gee White to  declare his intentions. White still has compensation for the pawn, but Black  is starting to free himself and should not be significantly worse, if at all.  A point worth noticing is 19.Dg2 g6 20.e4 c5! when the white centre is  being undermined. This is what can happen if Black is given the space he would  like. Here White has to enter terrible complications with 21.Axe6! fxe6 22.Txg6+ which should end in a draw with best play.] 18...Ag6 It is difficult  for Black to find a move.

Pieces One poorly-placed piece makes your whole position bad - Dr Siegbert Tarrasch Black can probably equalize by exchanging weaknesses, but he seeks a long game, where the d4-pawn might be a bit more exposed than the pawn on c6. How should he play in order to get the most our of his pieces? If pawns are the skeleton of a position, or "the soul of the game", then the pieces must be the flesh and blood, with the king being the heart and brains of the operation. Yet how well do most chess players really know their pieces? And how well do they treat them? Pieces certainly work like bees for the sake of the hive, but they are not workers like the pawns; staying with the terminology of the beehive, they are the drones. I personally like to think of the dynamics in a position as being a measurable quantity, where a piece can have a rather low value if it is poorly placed, while it can have quite a high value if it is excellently placed. Likewise, a piece can have low or high potential, based on the pawn structure and other factors. No doubt computer programmers work hard at refining these evaluations, though my limited knowledge suggests that they are at least equally interested in making the most out of the extra cores our computers are starting to have. The worst-placed piece While a programmer has to work out a quantifiable value to attribute to the pieces, in order to communicate with the machine, the human brain works in a more intuitive way. Looking at our pieces, it should not be too difficult to work out which of our pieces is worst placed. Ideal squares In Excelling at Chess, I introduced the idea of Looking for ideal squares for our pieces. Here we are not talking about their current dynamic value, but about their potential val ue. At times a poorly-placed piece will not have an obvious ideal square. The piece can be said to have low potential, at least for the time being. But at other times the ideal square can be quite attractive, although quite far away. As one of my three questions is "Which is the worst-placed piece?" the concept of ideal squares is certainly an important one to assimilate (and the way we do this is by paying attention to it again and again in training, or when we feel lost during a game). Here is a simple example of looking for the worst-placed piece and manoeuvring it to a decent square. 13...Dxd4! Line

It is quite obvious to me that the bishop on c8 is the worst-placed piece; it is not only devoid of any positive function, it is also in the way of the rook on a8! The ideal square for the bishop is in my opinion e4. Prandstetter clearly agreed with me, as he decided to manoeuvre it there. 17...Ad7! White is in a similar situation, looking at his pieces and trying to find out which ones should be performing much better. At the moment the knight on c2 looks more active than the rook on a1, but it is an illusion. The rook on a1 is only one move away from a good square (f1) , while the knight is painfully far from a good square. As nothing concrete is happening at the moment, Vaulin decided to put his knight on its ideal square. 18.Ce1 Ae8 19.Cd3 Ag6 20.Ce5 Ae4 Both players have achieved their aim and the position can be said be in balance. 21.Tf4 Axg2 22.Rxg2 Cd7 Black decides to neutralize the strong white knight instead of having a strong knight of his own. Maybe this is slightly inaccurate, but in practice it does not make a great deal of difference. [Most natural to me would have been 22...g5 23.Tf3 Ce4 24.Taf1 Txf3 25.Txf3 Tf8 and the position is completely level.] 23.Cxd7 Dxd7 24.Taf1 Txf4 25.Txf4 The only consequence of having played 22...♘d7 is that Black has to find the correct plan here. If White were given the chance to play e3-e4 he would have a slight edge. However, Black is focused and creates a good square for his queen on d5: 25...dxc4 26.bxc4 b5 27.Db3 [27.Dc3!? has the idea of continuing 27...bxc4 (It should instead be met with 27...Tc8 preparing ...c5 and making use of the rook.) 28.e4] 27...bxc4 28.Dxc4 Dd5+ 29.Dxd5 cxd5 Black's rook will come to c3 like a rocket, so he has no reasons to worry. 1/2 -1/2 This example of a bad bishop becoming good is of course very simple. Most people would have played this manoeuvre without thinking; if nothing else then because that is what you are supposed to do in the Stonewall. But the bishop manoeuvre makes sense also in more complicated scenarios, still based on the principle of putting the worst-placed piece on the ideal square. The following game is far from flawless, which just shows how difficult chess is, but Black's positional ideas are quite clear and powerful, when faced with an inconsequent opponent. Line

Somehow I had messed up the opening horribly. Basically I had been daydreaming rather than thinking. The big weakness in the black position is the c5-square, prompting my opponent to play a logical move. 14.Cb1! Not the only good move in the position, but its simplicity only increases my  admiration for it. 14...e6 Eventually I felt I had to play this unpleasant move. [14...Ah6 15.g3 Cg7 was the other way of playing I considered, but 16.Cbd2 Ce6 17.Rb1 would have been very unpleasant for Black. The ideas f4-f5 and  ♘d2-b3-a5/c5 are debilitating.] 15.Cbd2 Ah6 16.g3 c5? Desperation. [16...0-0-0 17.Cb3 Ca4 was better ... Although my position still stinks.] 17.dxc5 Ca4 18.Cb3 Af8 I offered a draw, which to my surprise was accepted.  I was hoping to generate counterplay, but do not believe I would have  succeeded, had the game continued. A short and relatively painless off-day. 1/  2-1/2 The final example in this section could have been solved if I had only  paid attention to my worst-placed piece. However, I did not think along those  lines at all. Line

Black is threatening the e4-pawn, but White should protect it in a way that makes sense. As Black's active options are ...d5 and . ..f5 , the white bishop is ideally placed on the passive looking f3-square. Another classic case of a bad bishop defending good pawns (Suba). The difference from a truly bad bishop is that this one has prospects, while a really bad bishop would have none. 20.Af3! [20.f3? would allow Black  to play 20...Ah6 with almost immediate equality.; 
20.Dd3!? would allow Black  to play 20...Tfd8 A key idea is 21.Af3 (And after 21.Tc7 d5 22.Txb7 d4 23.Ad2 Tab8 Black has some counter-chances, though White is still better because  of his passed pawn on the queenside.) 21...d5 22.exd5 Dxb4 when Black is  in the game.] 20...Tfd8 [20...Ah6? would now drop a piece to 21.g3] 21.Tc7 Tab8 This is the critical posmon (in the sense that I got it wrong! ) . Basically White's poorlyplaced piece is the rook on f1. My main copout is that I was a considerably weaker player back then and did not pay as much attention to my poorly-placed pieces as I should have. Even in my notes to the game in my private files, I do not pay any special attention to the inactive rook. The correct continuation was therefore: 22.Dd2! The immediate threat of winning the queen wins valuable time. [In  the game I played weakly with: 22.g3?! Df6 23.h4 h6 This was what I was  hoping for, and I assumed that my next move would be really strong. However,  it does nothing about bringing my worst-placed piece into the game. 24.h5? I a m not sure if I am going too far when I say that this is a positional  blunder. But it is certainly not a good move. (24.Rg2 would still have kept  a real advantage.) 24...gxh5! Somehow I had not considered this natural  move. I have to recapture or Black will play ...h4. 25.Axh5 d5 Black has  counterplay. White is maybe a bit better, but there is a lot of work needed to  win this game, and it took until move 64 to do so.] 22...h6 23.g3! Prophylaxis against the ...d5-break. [23.Ta1? d5! would give Black a  lot of unnecessary counterplay, based on the point that 24.exd5 e4 not only  wins back the d-pawn, but also creates a double threat to a1 and f3. White  could struggle on with 25.Dc1 but it would hardly be fun.] 23...Df6 24.Ag2 The bishop returns to safety, allowing White to follow up with ♖a1-a7  with a close to decisive advantage. Black will not be able to play ...d5 in a  meaningful way, as the ...e5-e4 tricks are gone. Line

16.a4! This strong move fixes the pawn structure on the  queenside to White's advantage. 16...b4 17.Cb1 a5 [In general Black would love  to play 17...c4 but White has 18.a5 in reply, giving Black no  compensation for the pawn whatsoever.] 18.Cbd2 White has control over the  c4-square, but he will not rush to play his knight there and allow exchanges.  In the game Black neglects his kingside and White launches an attack there,  meaning that he never gets round to occupying the c4-square. Still the  usefulness of the square is dominant in many lines, as Black has to defend it  vigorously. 18...Ab7 Perhaps Black considered ...f5, but this would only leave  his position with multiple weaknesses. 19.Tc1 Tc8 20.Ch4 f6 21.Ae3 g6 22.Ah6 Cg7 23.Ad3 As long as the black knight is on b6, the d2- knight will  wait and might consider going to the kingside as well. 23...De7 24.Dg4 Tf7 25.Tc2 Tc7 26.g3 Ac8 27.De2 At this point Black should probably stay passive, but  psychologically this is hard. 27...f5 28.f4! White is threatening ♘hf3,  which would win the battle for the e5-square. 28...fxe4 29.Cxe4 exf4 [29...Ab7 This looks natural, but White has a brilliant continuation that brings the  knight on h4 back into the game. 30.Axg7 Txg7 (30...Rxg7 31.f5 gxf5 32.Cxf5+ is even worse.) 31.f5 Dd8 32.fxg6 hxg6 33.Tf1 The threat of ♘f6+ is devastating. 33...Cxd5 34.Ac4 Finally, after 18 moves,  the control over the c4-square comes in handy, albeit only in a sideline! 34...Rh8 35.Td2 Cc3 36.De3 Axe4 37.Txd6 Ce2+ (37...Dxd6 38.Dh6+ Th7 39.Tf8+) 38.Axe2 Dxd6 39.Td1 Black will have to allow either 40. ♕xe4  with a winning position, or: 39...Dc6 40.Dh6+ Rg8 41.Ac4+ With a mating attack.] 30.Cxd6 Dxd6 31.Axf4 Txf4 [After 31...Dxd5 32.Axc7 Ab7 33.Ae4 Dxe4 34.Dxe4 Axe4 we can improve on Portisch's original annotations with 35.Txc5 winning immediately.] 32.gxf4 Dxf4 [32...Dxd5 33.De5 and White wins the  ending.] 33.De4 White is winning in the long run, but Black accelerated the  process with his next move. 33...Dg5+ 34.Tg2 Dd8 35.Cxg6!

Black's king is unsafe, no matter where she decides to put it. This factor causes the computer to wildly overestimate White's advantage, even if he does nothing. 22.h3! This excellent move prepares to exchange  the strong defender on e6 for the inactive bishop on e2. Black will either  have to weaken her kingside further (...fxe6) or the d5-square. 22...0-0 [22...Re7 was suggested by Ribli. This changes things greatly and should encourage  White to open the queenside immediately to take advantage of the exposed  position of the king in the centre: 23.b4 axb4 24.Txb4 b5 (24...Tc7 25.Tdb1 and the b7-pawn seems to be impossible to defend.) 25.Tdb1 Ad7 26.Df3 bxc4 27.Axc4 Black is struggling to defend her two weaknesses on f7 and h7.] 23.Dg3+ I am not really sure that transferring the queen to h4 improves  White's position. [I rather like 23.Ag4 Tfd8 24.Df3 Rg7 25.Axe6 fxe6 26.Tbc1 De7 27.Tc3 though in other lines Black is under pressure as well.] 23...Rh8 24.Dh4 De7 25.Ag4 Tg8 26.Td3!? Khalifman is deliberately  waiting before taking on e6; maybe he can avoid ...fxe6. [26.Axe6 fxe6 27.Td3 Tcd8 does not seem too dangerous for Black.] 26...Tg5?! Polgar is  dreaming of action on the g-file, when neutralizing the pressure down the  d-file should have been her priority. From here on things go downhill. [26...Tcd8 was necessary, with the point 27.Tbd1 Txd3 28.Txd3 Axg4 (28...Td8 29.Td5 based on 29...Axd5 30.Af5) 29.hxg4 Tg6 and Black seems to be okay.] 27.Axe6 Dxe6 [27...fxe6 28.Tbd1 with the threat of ♖d7, is highly unpleasant  for Black.] 28.Tbd1 Tcg8 [Black continues her "attack" on the kingside.  Better was 28...Db6 although Black's position is still extremely shaky.] 29.Td6 Dc8 [Black does not have time to take on g2, which exposes the flaws  with her strategy: 29...Txg2+ 30.Rf1 De7 31.Td7 Df8 32.Td8 De7 33.T1d7 De6 34.Td6 De7 35.T8d7 Df8 36.Dxf6+ and White will win the subsequent  ending.] 30.g3 Rg7 31.T1d5 White is winning no matter what. His domination  is total and Black's position is riddled with weaknesses. If Polgar now  intended to let the pawn go, I do not know, but it does not increase her  chances. 31...h6 32.Txe5 Td8 33.Ted5 Txd6 34.Txd6 Tg6 35.Df4 a4 36.bxa4 Dxc4 37.Td8 Dc3 38.Rg2 Db4 39.Ta8 h5 40.Db8 Dxe4+ 41.Rh2 Tg5 42.Dh8+ Rg6 43.Tg8+ Rf5 44.Dh7+ Line

Sacrifices to improve certain pieces (positional sacrifices) The positional sacrifice is a big theme and requires more than one book to cover it fully. I have already given one example above (Gelfand - Markowski) , but I would like to give a few more. If this does not satisfy your hunger, I would refer you to Mihai Suba's book on this theme, Positional Chess Sacrifices. 11.e5! A typical pawn sacrifice. White loses a pawn,  but the control over the e4-square and the death of the dynamics of the black  position are more than worth it. 11...Cxe5?! [Black has to accept the sacrifice,  as 11...Cg4 12.Ag5! followed by ♘b5 would be a disaster.; 
But maybe  Black should have aimed for more murky waters with 11...dxe5!? when the  knight on d7 could become active. For example: 12.Ac2 e4 13.Cg5 Ce5 14.De2 Cc6 15.Ae3 e5 Black is planning to occupy the d4-square and is not  significantly worse.] 12.Cxe5 dxe5 13.De2 Ad7 14.Ag5! White is ensuring  that he keeps control of the e4-square. 14...De8 15.Tad1 Ac6 16.b4 a6 17.Axf6 Txf6 18.Ae4 Another useful exchange, securing the e4-square for  the knight. Black's position is somewhat worse objectively, and incredibly  hard to defend in practice. 18...Tf8 19.Td2 Axe4 20.Cxe4 Da4 21.Dd3 Dc6 22.Tfd1 Ah6 23.Te2 Ag7 24.h4 Tf4 25.g3 Tf5 26.b5 White is trying to create  additional weaknesses in order to gain targets. 26...axb5 27.cxb5 Db6?! After  this passive move Black is pushed over the edge. [27...Dd5 was better,  although White keeps an edge after 28.Db1 Dc4 29.Te3 But the fact that he  has not managed to stabilize his queenside makes the outcome uncertain.] 28.Db3 Tf7 29.a4 h6 30.Dc4 White is more or less winning. There is no defence  against ♖ed2-d7. 30...Rh7 31.Td3 Te7 32.Ted2 c6 33.Db4 Tf7 34.Td7 Taf8 35.Dd6 Txd7 36.Dxd7 cxb5 37.axb5 Rh8 38.Td1 Da7 39.De7 The following example  touches on this issue from a different angle.

One matter I will not delve too far into in this book is the dynamic exchange of values that takes place when we sacrifice a piece or the exchange. What usually happens is that a structural improvement is exchanged for material investment, as in the following example. Here Kramnik gives up the exchange in order to take control of the c6-square. This time around the sacrifice does not come with any active possibilities, but as the position is fairly closed, it is hard for White to do anything with his rooks and for this reason the game was agreed drawn almost immediately. 26...Tec5! 27.Cc6 T8xc6 28.bxc6 Dxc6 29.Db4 h5 30.Db3 Rg7 31.Rf2 f6 32.Rg2 Ce5 33.Tbc1 Rh7 34.Tc3 Rh8 35.T3c2 Rg7 36.Tc3 Ta5 37.Ta1 Tc5 Line

22.De4! As the queen is immune, Black has to defend the bishop on b7, allowing White to take on h7 with a decisive advantage.[Loose pieces drop off I am not going to go deeply into this concept, but just mention it briefly. The phrase was first used in print by John Nunn. The idea is pretty simple - undefended pieces are weaknesses, just as undefended pawns are. Usually we would put this theme under tactics, but we should also remember that basically all positions have some tactical element. So rather than go into a long speech about this, I will show a simple example and ask you to get used to being aware of which pieces are undefended from time to time. Who knows, maybe you will get a chance like the following and not let it pass? In this complicated middlegame posmon, White played 22.Td3? after which the position was unclear and the game was won on move 39 by Black. Usually we would put a position like this in a book on tactics or calculation (candidate moves) , but it illustrates our example quite well . Because of the undefended nature of the bishop on b7 and the pawn on h7, White could have taken a big step towards winning the game with a nice little tactic:]  Line

White wants to play ♖g1 and g4-g5 , in the long term, to cramp the black pieces. He might also want to exchange the light-squared bishops at some point with ♗g4. Black's worst pieces are the h7-knight and g7-bishop. Both have been moved, but are unhappy where they are. The weakness in the white position is the dark squares, especially f4, so it is natural to seek an influence there, which is exactly what Black did. 12...Af6! 13.Cf1 [13.Ah6 does not achieve anything. Black is just as happy with the rook on e8 as  f8 , as he intends to play ...♖h8 eventually anyway.] 13...Ag5 14.Dd2 Df6 15.0-0-0 Af4! Making room for the knight on h7 to enter the game.

This position is of course not greatly complicated, and the solution is simple.

White is able to use all his advantages to bring his currently restricted pieces on d3 and c3 to life. Black has three obvious weaknesses, d6, g5 and h5, and a less obvious weakness on h7. If he had the time to play ... ♘f4, he would be laughing, but it is White to go. 14.e5! A typical move  for the Modern Benoni, forcing Black to put a pawn on his beloved e5-square,  opening up lines for the white pieces and clearing the way for the cl-pawn's  advancement.

White's position looks visually better. He has two bishops and his pieces are active. On top of this his king is safer - slightly passive, but safer. Of course, if the queens were exchanged, Black's king position would change from exposed to active. And the three slightly exposed pawns on a3, d4 and h4 would become more important. This is the reason for Eljanov's next move. 27...De7! Preparing ...♘f5 and the exchange of queens. This  will not solve all of Black's problems at once, but it goes a long way towards  making Black's position playable. 28.g3 Not the most dangerous; White can  retain a slight edge, though it is not easy to see how. [28.Ad3 Cf5 29.Da4! produces some problems for Black, but they can all be solved.

Axf5 34.Ab5 and  White wins the exchange after 34...Db7 35.Aa6 with serious winning chances in  the resulting endgame.

A very natural idea is 28.Ae2 g6 29.Da4 to get the queen to an active square with tempo. But there are downsides  too - it does not solve the problem with the pawns, and the bishop is a bit  exposed on e2. 29...Cf5 looks almost equalizing to me. 30.Tc7 and now: a) 30...Td7 is pun ished by (b) 30...Ad7!

White has an inactive bishop on d3. The great weakness in the black position is the pawn on e6 (and the light squares in general as a consequence of the earlier exchange of White's dark-squared bishop for the f6- knight) .

White has achieved quite a comfortable position out of the opening, bur needs to breathe more life into his pieces in order to make something of it. To do so he will have to advance his pawns on the queenside eventually, while also putting some pressure on Black in the centre and making it hard for him to mobilize his forces. Looking at the black position, we can see chat the bishops are a bit exposed. Combine these factors and we have an obvious candidate. 15.Ce2! A nice multipurpose move i:hat aims to harass  the black bishops, at the same time clearing the way to reinforce the d4-pawn  with ♗d2-c3 and preparing to advance with b2-b4. 15...Cbd7 In a bad position  there are no good moves. Black decides to give up his bishop in order to get  his pieces out. Had he chosen otherwise, he might have been criticised for  neglecting his development. The fact of the matter is that he was facing an  unpleasant choice.

This position could be a little controversial. The computers I have asked do not fully agree about the power of Shomoev's move. Hopefully I will be able to explain it convincingly. 14.Ab4! The point of this move  is two-fold. First of all White is ridding himself of his bad bishop, a  general positional idea. Secondly, by exchanging it for the knight, he is  creating a position where the bishop on c8 will always be bad. This is a  simple case of good pieces and bad pieces. I do not want to make it any more  complicated than this, though of course it is more complicated than this in  practice. 14...Te8 15.Axe7 Dxe7 16.Cc5 Td8 17.Tc1 Tb8 18.b3 Ab7 19.Tc4 White  won on move 45.

This theoretical position was considered decent for Black until this game. But actually Anand's novelty is not so difficult to work out. Black has sacrificed a pawn in order to split White's pawns and get active play against them. The hint as to the solution to this position is the lame goat on e2. It is almost impossible to find a good square for this knight, no matter how far you manoeuvre it around, so the idea of just giving it up should pop into your mind sooner or later - it just takes a little imagination. 16.Cd4! This leaves the knight on a5 out on a limb to some extent, bur there is  not really any alternative - Black needs to get into the game quickly and must  be prepared to give back the piece. 16...exd4 17.cxd4 Cbc6 18.Dc3 Ce7 A  necessity.

Black is offered the chance to give White tripled pawns. The question is whether this is a good thing or not - and the answer is yes, although it is quite double-edged. The main swaying factors are that the bishop on d7/c6 will find little resistance on the light squares and that the white bishop will find it difficult to live up to its full potential, as the pawns on c3 and c5 prevent it using the long diagonal. 8...Cxc4! 9.dxc4 Axc3 10.bxc3 Ac6 The reasons for Black's advantage are given above.

It is apparent that White will have to exchange his bishop in a moment. The question is of course for which minor piece. The easiest way for us to determine this is to investigate the positions arising from the various options and look at their positional features one by one. This can be time-consuming and grandmasters will not do this consciously, but they will do it subconsciously. 19.Axc5! [19.Axg5? Dxg5 gives White nothing. For  example, 20.Dg3 Dxg3 21.Cxg3 f4 22.Cf1 a5 and Black is by no means worse.;

For some reason White refrained from playing: 26.Ae7! This would exchange the f8-bishop, thereby relieving Black of his bishop pair  and all chances of defending the dark squares (and in particular the c5-pawn ).  I guess that she simply missed the idea com pletely. White's advantage would  be considerable. I nstead she went on to lose in 58 moves. Line

Prophylaxis In a game between two of the top women players in the world, White is looking for an attack on the kingside as well as a small positional trick. How should Black address this? Chess is played with pieces, and games are won by attacking the opponent's weaknesses. But it is not enough to focus on our own ambitions; we have to remember that our opponent has every second move. This is why it is important for us to include prophylactic thinking in our arsenal of thinking tools. In this chapter we will look at some of the most common aspects of prophylactic thinking. The idea behind the last move Prophylactic thinking is best described as attention to the opponent's ideas. It is nor the reaction to them or the prevention of them; it is simply taking them into account. One of the ways to do this is to think about the point of your opponent's last move. 21...Dc6! Line

With my last move, 12.♗c1-d2?!, I had anticipated my opponent's obvious  break, but had not seen far enough . It transpires that the bishop needed to  be on f4, when White was probably a bit better. 12...dxc4! 13.Axc4 c5! So instead I decided to complete my development with the aid of a tactical  idea. 14.Tc1? Again it makes sense for Black to ask himself what White  intended with his last move. It appears that taking twice on d4 and then e5 is  not possible, as White can then play 17.♘xe6! with an advantage. Armed with  this knowledge, my opponent looked for a flaw in my thinking - and found it. [After he played this, I sank in to deep, desperate thought. My opponent had  anticipated my planned reply to this break, 14.d5 exd5 15.Axd5 which gave  him the chance to look deeper and see that 15...Cxe5 would give him"a significant  advantage.; 
In retrospect, it would have been better to fight for equality  with 14.dxc5 Cxc5 15.Cxc5 Axc5 16.a6 b6 17.Tc1 when White is probably  still sort of okay.] 14...Cxd4! The main point of my opponent's play  becomes visible only after: 15.Cbxd4 [I now played 15.Ac3 and managed to  create some resistance before I blundered again at move 40.] 15...cxd4 16.Cxd4 Txc4 [As said, Black will not fall for 16...Cxe5? 17.Cxe6 when  White has the advantage. He no doubt intended to play:] 17.Txc4 Ad3 And the  e5-pawn will be lost. Bue of course prophylaxis can at times be far more basic.  In the following example Black failed to look for his opponent's idea  carefully enough, and went down in a very painful way. Line

Your opponent's long-term goals Prophylaxis can be quite deep, of course, but it is always a question of style. For example, Petrosian was famous for preventing his opponents' ideas long before they ever got the chance to have chem. And Karpov probably spent more of his time looking for ways to eliminate his opponent's possible desires than any other World Champion, which explains why he drew so often with Black. With White, he would prevent his opponent from equalizing and keep the pressure on, until a pleasant ending would arise. With Black, he would prevent the opponent from gaining an advantage, rather than looking for ways to gain one himself. Is this you? If you are an attacking player, then probably not. On the other hand, if you are more like an accountant than an axewielding madman, maybe this is you. In general, prophylaxis becomes more important when you have a static advantage. In endgames, following the advice, " Do not hurry!" and preventing counterplay are the key technical tools. But the principle seems sound in all phases of the game. Here is a good example straight out of the opening. 14.e3! Defending the d4-pawn in advance. White could have reversed his 14th and  15th moves, but this is more human and maybe a bit more flexible. [Black is  under slight pressure down the long diagonal and will have to free himself  with . . . ♖c8 and . . . d6, as after 14.-- d5? 15.cxd5 cxd5 16.Cxd5! White wins material. Black's weakness is the h5-pawn, so Eljanov decided to  prepare the ♘e5-d3-f4 manoeuvre to put pressure on it.] 14...Tc8 15.Tac1! Eljanov again prevents his opponent's idea. Still Eljanov's solution is  simply better; it involves no risk and leaves Black with no easy choices. [It is slightly less important that White also would be m uch better after 15.Cd3 d5 because of 16.cxd5 Axd3 17.Txd3 (Eljanov only considers 17.d6 which also gives White some advantage.) 17...cxd5 18.Cxd5 exd5 19.Dxd5 Cd7 20.Dxh5 White will also grab the g4-pawn with a huge advantage, as Black  would shed more material after 20...Cf6 21.De5 The game is of course not decided  yet, but Black is going to struggle to prove his compensation.] 15...d6 16.Cd3 Ah6 I do not particularly like this move; it relies too much on White putting his knight on f4, as the bishop will otherwise be entirely out of play. [After 16...Cd7 17.Cf4 Cf6 18.Ce4 Black would find  defending the h5-pawn very difficult.] 17.Da4!? Again a beautiful  practical decision by Eljanov. White is preparing d4-d5 and an assault on the  light squares, now that the darksquared bishop is out of play on h6. [Having  said that, we should note that 17.Cf4 was perfectly fine as well: 17...Axf4 18.exf4 Cd7 19.Te1 There is no way for Black to defend against the th reats of f4-f5 and d4-d5, as White is plan ning to play ♕a3 or ♕a4, forking important squares. I think White is more or less winning al ready.] 17...Ab7 18.d5 White continues with his plan.  Putting the knight on f4 was still a serious option. 18...b5 Desperation. [18...cxd5 19.cxd5 e5 also does not work. White would play 20.Cb4 and ♗e4-f5  with close to complete domination.] 19.dxc6! A nice little tactic that  effectively wins the game. [Again there was a plausible alternative: 19.cxb5 cxd5 20.Axd5 Txc3 21.Axb7 Txc1 22.Axa8 Txd1+ 23.Dxd1 and White has  an extra pawn. On the ocher hand, Black has managed to solve some of his  problems and he might have a chance of saving the ending.] 19...Axc6 20.Cxb5 a6 21.Axc6 Cxc6 22.Cc3 White has won a pawn and won the game on move 53.  Good prophylactic play by Eljanov in a position where many would have looked  too soon for a dynamic way to exploit the advantage. The next example shows  how we should be careful not to allow our opponents even small improvements;  something we can only do if we pay sufficient attention to their intentions.  In this example we shall discuss various aspects of prophylactic thinking -  armed with the power of hindsight. Line

Prophylactic thinking in action - combine it with your own ideas Up to this point we have repeatedly seen how sound prophylactic thinking can be combined with achieving our own goals. In the following position Black is looking for ways to complete his development and get rid of his potentially weak pawn on d7 (as well as take control over the d-file) . At the same time he managed to look out for his opponent's ideas. White is struggling a bit. His pieces are not well placed and Black has managed to obtain the two bishops. However, if he can play ♘d3 and either ♘f4 or ♗b4, things would change quite quickly and the advantage Black has at the moment could quickly disappear. To counter this plan is Black's main objective in this position. I managed to do so by assaulting the centre at the same time. 16...d6! [Lines I looked at during the game were 16...Db6 17.Cd3 Tc2 18.Tfc1 Tfc8 19.Ab4; 
and 16...f6 17.Cd3 fxe5 18.dxe5 Tc4 19.f3 although not with the detail, accuracy and confidence I can attach now after  looking at the game with computer assistance.] 17.Ab4 This is of course the  apparent problem with my move. But I had someth ing special planned here. [My main idea with the game move is that 17.Cd3 dxe5 would force White to  play 18.Cxe5 (because of 18.dxe5? Ac4) ] 17...dxe5 [17...a5 was also  very strong, but I like my move best.] 18.Axe7 Dxe7 19.dxe5 Ac4 20.Cd3 This is the second moment of prophylaxis in the game. I correctly evaluated the "main" defensive option , the one he went for in the game. But we both missed that he had another option that would have held his position together. 20...Tfd8? The game was played with only one hour for the  first thirty moves, which is the excuse for this inaccuracy. [20...Dd7! 21.Tfd1 Tfd8 would transpose to the game.] 21.Tfd1? White misses a great  tactical defence. [He should have played 21.Tfc1 when Black only has  traces of an advantage due to the exploitation of the back rank. The best try  is probably 21...Axd3 22.Txc8 Txc8 23.Dxd3 Dg5 24.Te1 Td8 25.Dc3 Dd2 26.Dc1 but it is not much.] 21...Dd7 22.Td2 This looks like the best chance, but  I was ready for it. 22...Dd4!! I cannot force the win of a piece, but I can  create a pawn weakness in the white position. 23.Tad1 Dxe3 24.fxe3 Axd3? This is entirely unnecessary. The bishop outshines the knight in each and  every way. Somehow I had the idea that the rook ending was just winning, which  is more than a bit optimistic. 25.Txd3 Txd3 26.Txd3 g5 White might still have some fighting chances in the endgame, especially if he manages to keep out the black king on the kingside by putting a pawn on g4. However, this is not the only problem in the position. If Black manages to play . . . a5 and . . . ♖c5, it seems very unlikely that White will be able to hold. 27.Td6? After this the ending is lost. [For this reason the  only move was 27.Ta3!?] 27...a5 28.Ta6 a4 29.b3 axb3 30.axb3 Tc3 31.Rf2 h5 32.Rf3 Txb3 33.h3 Tc3 34.Tb6 Tc5 35.Re4 h4 36.Rd4 Tc2 37.Txb5 Txg2 38.Tb1 Tg3 39.Th1 Rg7 40.Re4 Rg6 41.Th2 Rh5 42.Tf2 Txh3 43.Txf7 Tg3 44.Tf6 h3 45.Tf8 Rg4 Prophylactic thinking is essential for playing at grandmaster  level and is at the same time very difficult. I hope the exercises in this  book will help you to hone this skill. ♘ ♕ ♗ ♔ ♖ Line

Black looks a little worse, mainly because he is not able to make anything out of his dark-squared bishop. You could easily imagine that the evaluation would be entirely different if the bishop was on e5! If we look carefully we will see that Black's only route for the bishop is from e7 to g7 via f8. By energetic play White was able to prevent this. 20.h4!! A great  move for a 14-year-old to play. Maybe he was lucky and just found move 22 when  he got there? Probably not; players this great do not rely on luck and neither  should you. 20...Af8 21.h5 g6 22.h6 Black is left in a very passive situation.

White has a typical good knight against bad bishop, but he is lacking in targets and Black has decent pressure down the e-file, which occupies one of the white rooks. The only real weakness in the black camp is the g6-pawn, but rather than attacking this immediately, White should use the fact that Black is not planning anything active to improve his position first of all. 25.Cd3!

The other way to find the right move is to focus on penetrating along the b-file. In the game White did not find the right way to do this, playing 24.Tdb1? and after 24...a5! Black was suddenly in with a shout. It should be mentioned that Black actually made a strong comeback and even won the game some 60 moves later. If White had looked for a way to take this resource away from Black, he would have found the right move as well. 25.Cc8 Dc7 26.Cb6 Txb1+ 27.Txb1 Ta7]  Line

It should be quite obvious that Black has done okay our of the opening. White is not about to launch an offensive anywhere, and he has some pawn weaknesses on the queenside. However, Black also needs to form a plan to seize the initiative. The way to play this position is to realize that White has a weak square on c4 along with the weak pawns on a3 and b4, and that the knight on a6 is our of play and could do much better. By transferring this knight to c4, Black makes White's existence very difficult. 14...Cc7! 15.e3 Ce8 16.De2 Cd6 17.Tfc1 Cc4 Black is better, but White has played  sensibly, so he retains drawing chances. 18.Ae1!

The weakest point in the black posmon must be the f6-square, though one could argue for the f7-pawn to be included on the list of weaknesses. Black also has a traditional bad bishop on d7 and a misplaced queen on b6. His main ideas are to play ...f5 or ...dxe4, in both cases solving some of the problems with his pawn structure as well as aiming to activate the bishop. White wants to find something for his knights to do, as well as keep his advantages. For this reason the correct move is to advance the e-pawn. 18.e5! f5? After this move White's advantage is obvious, as  his pieces flow easily to e5 and other attractive squares. I was more  interested in what would have happened had Black decided to play on the  queenside, where he is stronger. [The best move is: 18...Dd8! Besides  clearing the way for the b-pawn, the queen is ready to come to g5 and h4 in  many lines involving the thrust f2-f4. It took us some time to work out the  correct plan for White to prove an advantage, and even after this work, it  feels as if the resources of the position have by no means been exhausted. The  following is certainly not something you would need to see in order to solve  the original problem, but it is very interesting and instructive. 19.Cg4! After trying various plans, we decided to rely on this one, which tries to  make use of the poorly placed knight in an active capacity. This is a rather  slow plan, but White has a head start on the kingside, so he can afford the  slow manoeuvring. 19...b5 The most natural move. (It turns out that 19...Cf5 is premature. Rather than being active on f5 , the knight is a target there.  White plays 20.Tfe1 b5 21.Cf1 b4 22.Cfe3 and now Black is in a tight  squeeze. Either he allows Wh ite to take on f5 and play ♘e3, which is very  dangerous for him, or he exchanges the knights, allowi ng White to start an  attack on the kingside: 22...Cxe3 23.Txe3 Tb8 24.Tf3! bxc3 25.bxc3 Db6 It  might look as if Black will be just in time with ...♕b2, but the counterplay  fails to a nice tactic: 26.Axf7+!! Txf7 27.Dg6 Txf3 28.Cf6++-) 20.a3!! This deep move was found by John Shaw. The idea was at first to make Black  play ...a5 to support the advance of the b-pawn, because ...♕a5 had been  irritating us in several lines. Analysis then suggested other, unforeseen  advantages of this move. (20.Tfe1 b4! turns out to give Black enough  counterplay. After 21.Cf1 Tb8 22.Cfe3 Cc6 23.Tf1 Rh8! it is not easy to  make progress with White. The last move is important because of these ♗xf7+  combinations which keep popping up all over the place.) 20...a5 21.Tfe1 Rh8 The immediate push on the queenside falls prey to another tactic. (After 21...b4 22.axb4 axb4 23.Cf6+ Axf6 24.Txa8 Dxa8 25.exf6 White's advantage  is obvious. Black has several ways to play, but none of them satisfactory. The  key point is that he cannot play 25...Cc6 26.Cf3 Dd8 which would otherwise be  the logical thing to do, as White once again wins with: 27.Axf7+!! Txf7 28.Dg6+ Rf8 29.Dxh6+ Re8 30.Dh8+ Tf8 31.Dh5+ Tf7 32.Cxg5 Dxf6 33.Cxf7 Dxf7 34.Dxd5! and the black position is not going to last.) 22.Cf1 b4 23.Cfe3 White has an edge. He is intending to play ♖f1 and f2-f4 with action on the  kingside. There is still a lot to play for, but the general outlook for Black  is not great. Here is one possible line: 23...Tb8 (23...bxc3 24.bxc3 Tb8 would  allow White to play 25.Tab1! White can successfully challenge Black  for the b-file, because the possibility of jumping in with ♘f6 keeps the  black queen occupied on the kingside.) 24.axb4 axb4 25.f4 gxf4 26.gxf4 Cc6 27.f5 White's idea is that Black cannot play: 27...Dg5? 28.f6 Dxh5 29.fxg7+ Rxg7 30.Cf6 And the bishop on d7 hangs.] 19.exf6 Txf6 20.Cg4 Tf5 21.Cf3 Dd6 22.Tfe1 Ae8 23.Axe8 Txe8 24.Te2 Cc6 25.Tae1 Te7 26.Txe6 Txe6 27.Dxf5 Txe1+ 28.Cxe1 Ce7 29.Df3 Dg6 30.Rf1 b5 31.Ce3 De6 32.a3 a5 33.g4 b4 34.axb4 axb4 35.C1c2 b3 36.Cb4 Axd4 37.cxd4 c3 38.bxc3 b2 39.Dd1 De4 40.Cd3 Line

By employing a short-term tactical threat, White manages to create a great square for his knight on c4. 21.c4! Black does  not have time to play 21...b4, as the e-pawn is hanging. 21...Ad6 22.Aa5!?

White is of course better. He has won a pawn and has no great problems beyond the doubled pawns on the g-file, which can hardly be called weak. However, his position is not entirely stable. Black is about to play ...♖c2 and ...♖ac8, creating counterplay against the b2-pawn and on the second rank in general . It is important for Wh ite to fi rst minimize this counterplay, before he thinks about how to convert his advantage. 25.Ad2! And this is the way to do it. Once the bishop is on c3, it will  achieve the double whammy of blocking the c-file and stabilizing the position. 25...Tc2 Black has to get the rook into the white position before it is too lace. 26.Ac3 Rf8 27.Td2 Tc8 28.Tad1 Re7 29.Rf2 Tc4 30.Re3 White has made it  through the first stage; the position is completely stabilized. He can now  look for ways to convert his advantage. 30...Af5 31.Th1 g6 In opposite-coloured  bishop endings It is common for the player without ambitions to put his pawns  on the same-coloured squares as his bishop, as this makes chem easy to defend,  though impossible to advance. For the player wanting to win, the opposite is  usually the case. He will try to challenge the opponent's bishop and seek to  advance his pawns, so he has to fight for the squares that his own bishop does  not control. 32.Th4 White offers an exchange of rooks, which is attractive  to Black, but also unravels White's doubled pawns. 32...Txh4 33.gxh4 a6 34.Rd4 Rd7 35.Rc5 Rc7 36.a4 Black is almost in zugzwang. He could exchange rooks  on d2, but probably felt that his chances to draw this ending would be slim.  White can aim to obtain a passed pawn on b6. Then he will put his king on g5  or f6 and play g2-g4 . This will either create a weakness on h5, or it will  force Black to play ...hxg4, when after fxg4, White is ready to advance the  h-pawn to create a second passed pawn and claim the bishop for it. From a  practical point of view, this ending did not attract Shirov, but maybe it was  the best chance. 36...Tc1? [Black should have played 36...Txd2 37.Axd2 Ad7! making it very difficult for White to advance his b-pawn . Remember, if White  plays 38.a5? Black can always defend his queenside with the bishop on the  b5- f1 diagonal, and the king can rush to the kingside and prevent any  concessions there.(White can try 38.Rb4!? but after 38...Rb6 39.Ae3+ Rc6 40.Ra5 Rd5 41.b3 Ac8 the game is sharper than White would want it to be.  Although it is obvious that it is White who is trying to win here, I think  Black should draw. This does not necessarily mean that White has done anyth  ing wrong up to this point, or that the initial evaluation needs to be revised.  To be better simply means that if you make a small mistake, or if the opponent  defends perfectly, the game is likely to revert to equilibrium. And to be  worse simply means that you have to defend well nor to lose, that the margin  for error is lim ited. I n this game Shirov did not defend perfectly. I  believe that this move was the critical mistake, but these endings are very  difficult to understand, so I shall not feign certai nty.) ] 37.g4!

The position seems relatively quiet and Black's next move might seem obvious to most, as I am sure it was to Akopian. However, we might not necessarily be talking about the same move. The solution to this position is the move that combines the necessary defensive obligations (avoiding mate in one) and active possibilities. 15...f5! The reason some  might hold back from this move is that it weakens the e6- pawn. However, that  is not relevant in this position. After the advance of the f-pawn, the black  king is absolutely safe and White is likely to have to play a more defensive  role than he would wish, due to the weakness of the d4-pawn. [The other  automatic move was 15...h6?! After 16.0-0 the position is roughly  balanced, but it would be Black who had to play accurately over the next ten  moves.] 16.0-0 Tf6!? This aggression on the kingside is of course very  attractive, but it was not the only way to play the posmon. Black could also  have improved his standing in the centre first, by ...♖c8 or by rerouting  the d7-knight. 17.Ad2 White is struggl ing for a plan and thus falls down  quickly. The idea of this move is to prevent ...♖h6, but in itself that  might not be devastating. [He should of course avoid automatic moves such as 17.Tad1? because after 17...Th6 18.De3 Dh4 19.Dg3 Tg6! Black is already  winning.; 
17.Tfe1 also looks a bit suspicious. Black plays 17...Tg6 18.Af1 Dg5 followed by ...♖f8, ...♘f6 or ...f4, with a terrible attack.; 
The best  option might be to play 17.De3!? to bring the queen into the game. Black  would of course have options such as the most flexible 17...Th6 (and 17...f4!? 18.Dd2 f3 in both cases with an initiative for Black. However, I do not see  why White should not be able to hold his position together.) ] 17...Tg6 18.f3 Cb8 A very natural regrouping of the knight. [However, the more creative 18...Ab7!? was worth considering. The main ideas are ...♘c5! or ...  ♘e5!?, though playing ...♘f6-d5 also becomes an option. The thinking  behind the retreat is chat the bishop is less useful on d5 once White has  closed the long diagonal, whereas a knight on that square may demonstrate that  f2-f3 has compromised the white position.] 19.Tac1? This simply blunders  a pawn. [After the correct 19.Ae3 Cc6 20.Tad1 the position remains  complex. I would consider Black's chances to be slightly better and his  position easier to play, with ideas such as ...♕f6, ... ♖c8 and ...♘a5.  But with accurate play, there is no doubt that White will be able to  neutralize this slight pull.] 19...Cc6 White cannot easily defend the  d-pawn. 20.Ae3 Df6 21.Ac4? White is in the midst of a complete collapse.

The bishop on b7 looks good, as bishops on long diagonals usually do. However, because of the way the game has evolved, there is nothing of great importance on that diagonal; it is all on the other long diagonal.

20.Axc5! [After 20.Axg7 Rxg7 21.Tb1 White's advantage  would have been minimal. The d6- pawn is a bit weak, but Black's knight on c5  is strong, so he would not fear this development greatly.] 20...dxc5 21.Tb1 White's advantage is maybe not earchshattering, but if we look at all of the  elements individually, we can see that the black position is quite unpleasant.  First of all, he has three weak pawns on the queenside, which are all unable  to improve themselves greatly. White may consider ♘b3 with an attack on the  c5- pawn and there will be no convenient way to defend it. Then there is the  bishop currently on b7. Although it can be activated, this will take time and  simultaneously leave the c6-pawn more exposed. Finally, what should have been  an asset for Black, the g7-bishop, is shooting into a complete void. There is  nothing of interest to anyone on the a1-h8 diagonal. The game is simply  decided elsewhere. 21...Tbd8 22.Ah3!?

In positions with compensation for a material deficit, it is often a great advantage for the player who has given up material to have opposite-coloured bishops. This position is no exception.

Another structural point is chat the f4-pawn is fixed as a weakness. This might sound irrelevant when we are in a defensive position, but it is not so. We should always aim to create weaknesses in our opponent's position; even for defensive purposes.

Black has to deal with all of these as well as finding an orderly way to complete his development.

White practically never takes the knight on c5 in the King's Indian, even though it doubles Black's pawns. Basically the control over the dark squares is more important and Black's dark-squared bishop is liable to become good in the long run. However, this position is an exception because White is able to push his pawn to d6 and obtain a fantastic square on d5 for his knight. Even if it is taken, a lot of light squares will remain weak in the black position. 13.Axc5! dxc5 14.d6 cxd6 [14...c6 15.Ca4 is just  useless.] 15.Dxd6 De6 16.Tad1 Dxd6 17.Txd6 Ae6 18.Cd5 White has the  advantage, though it is open for debate how big it is.

A classic example of what I call the absent bishop. A bishop can be absent either by having gone to another diagonal or, as in this case, by being exchanged. White is able to benefit from the lack of a dark-squared bishop by undermining the dark squares with a typical push. 16.c5! Black has excellent control over the light squares in his position; it  is on the dark squares he is suffering. 16...bxc5 Black has no alternatives. 17.Axe5 dxe5 18.dxe6 White wins back the pawn while Black's position is left in  ruins. 18...Dxe6 19.Dxc5 Cd7?!

White has a lead in development, but in principle Black has a better structure. Should Black get all his pieces int o play there is a good chance that he would equalize without too much trouble. For this reason the best exploitation of the lead in development is to give up the exchange and bring in the remai ning pieces rapidly. 11.Txd7!

White's idea is to take on h7 with check. It is not an effective offensive idea, as he can do nothing to make it happen; but as a defensive idea it is valid. For this reason, Black's worst-placed piece is his king. Ernst solved this elegantly. 33...Rf8!! Besides reducing the impact  of ♕xh7 (no longer check) this also defends against the back rank mate.

A fairly standard-looking Sicilian position where the engines probably overestimate White's chances on principle because the b5- pawn would be better placed on b7. This is indeed the main problem in the black position and White should target this immediately: 23.a4! b4?! This allows  White to execute her idea and is therefore a bit compliant. [23...bxa4 24.Cxa4 Db4 is not something anyone would want to play, but here it was  necessary. White can now play 25.Cc3 and keep the pressure on(or she can  win a pawn with 25.Cbc5 Dxe1 26.Cxd7+ Rc7 27.Txe1 Rxd7 28.Tc3 and Black  cannot save her a-pawn.

White uses the extra tempo to open lines to the black  king (or to gain access to the a4-square) . 24...Cxa5 [24...Db7 25.Ca4 is also  devastating. White will most likely just play ♘b6, ♘d4 and ♖b3.

Of the light squares, it is the d3-square that is weakest of them all. For this reason, Black should have taken the chance to play 26...Cb2! The threats of ...♘d3 and ...♗d3 are very real. If Black wins back the exchange then material will be equal, but Black will then enjoy his better pawn structure and the chances he has on the kingside by advancing the pawns there. Should White try to save the exchange, he can land in big problems: 27.a4 [27.Ta1 Cd3 28.Ted1 does not save anything. Black wins with 28...f5, trapping the queen.] 27...Ad3!

Unless something happens, White will have quite a clear advantage due to his better structure. Black's c-pawns are permanently weak and White's presence in the centre is powerful. But this is all static thinking. If we look at the dynamics, we can see White is struggling a bit with his development. Usually this would encourage Black to attack, but it is quite limited what he can do - he lacks targets and active pieces. Surprisingly, matters look better for Black the moment he forces the exchange of queens. 15...Df5! 16.Dxf5 [16.Dd2? would be a desirable move, were  it not for the reply 16...De4+ winning something.] 16...Axc3+ 17.bxc3 Axf5 The dust has cleared and we can see clear improvements for Black. The c-pawns  are still weak, but it is now very difficult to attack them. Black can instead  get some benefits from the open files, especially the b-file, where Black is  controlling White's entry square. 18.Ac4 [18.0-0-0 Tb8 19.Ad3 was another  logical way to play.

White had better prepare himself rapidly to deal with such challenges. 22.Cd2! f5 23.Cc4 This has the disadvantage of exchanging Black's stupid knight on a5, but at the same time it gets rid of White's lame horse and secures the bishop a great square on c4, where it blocks counterplay down the c-file. [23.Dh5 Df7 looks about even to me.] 23...Ae7? A bad blunder, allowing White to carry out a decisive attack. [23...Cxc4 24.Axc4 Df7 with chances for both sides, was suggested by Maxim Norkin.

Black's weakness is the b7/c6 constellation. Wh ite is able to make use of his strong bishop on f3 to put these pawns under pressure. Obviously, the light squares are the weakness (and maybe to some extent the b7-pawn) , with the c6-pawn being the hook. 13.b4! Eljanov suspected that  his opponent had missed this idea somehow. It is not completely standard, but  when you look for weaknesses in the black position, it becomes very logical. 13...Dc7 14.b5 Black is under definite pressure, even if it is a good way from  being decisive. 14...Cb6 15.Db3 exd4 16.exd4 In theory this pawn is isolated;  but to call it a weakness is a stretch.

White has a slight edge because of his superior pieces, but the game still has to be won - and this can only be done by good moves. In positions like this where there is a small but clear structural advantage (passed pawn and better pieces) , it is usually important to increase the number of advantages in order to get anywhere. Here this happens by creating additional weaknesses, as all of White's pieces are already placed on good active squares. 24.h4! White threatens to play h4-h5, taking advantage of  the slight ways the black kingside has been compromised. Black may now play 24.  ..h5, when White replies 25.g3, and the weakness of the g5-square combined  with the X-ray from b3 to f7 increases Black's discomfort a little. Or he can  allow White to advance the pawn. Personally I would probably have played 24...  h5, but the fact that Aronian, now the solid No. 2 in the world, chose not to,  shows that the choice is by no means easy. 24...Tad8!? As mentioned, I do not  fully trust this move. [24...f5?! would on the other hand be the wrong  track entirely. Black is passive and worse and will find that "active" lunges  like this only create weaknesses. After the natural moves 25.Cxd6 Dxd6 26.h5 g5 27.Dc2! White is threatening to check on c7 as well as to rake on f5 .  And after 27...Df6 White can play either 28.Dd3!? (or 28.d6 in both cases  with a clear edge.) ] 25.h5 f5! This is now forced.

26.e5! This would have been incredibly strong. The white  king's position is quite open, but there is no way for Black to get his bishop  to work together with the heavy artillery to take advantage of this. On the  other hand it is quite easy to see that the white bishop on b2 will provide  real support to the attack against g7. On top of this the black queenside will  fracture, pawns will drop and weaknesses persist. If White is not winning  after this, he is at least close. [The game ended in a draw after: 26.Td5?!

28...Df7 29.Dxc6 Td6 30.Dc5 lets  White stay in control as well. He is immediately threatening an invasion on e7.] 29.Dc4+ [29.Dc3!? is also very strong. White has f4- f5 ideas as well  as posing the simple question : what is Black going to play on the next move?] 29...Rf8 30.Dxa6 Black has hardly any compensation for the pawn. His only  chance is to play 30...c5 and try to draw the ending. White can choose between  several continuations, all of them featuring a passed pawn on the queenside  and strong pressure against g7.

White has made the most out of the Berlin endgame. At chis point he has the chance to get rid of his slightly limiting pawn on e5 (which is usually blockaded and in the way of the white pieces) and take on g7. Such an option to use tactics for positional gains should not be missed. 18.e6! Cxe6 Otherwise White simply takes on g7. 19.Cf5 Af8 20.Cxg7! The  brilliant point. Black will not be able to defend the d7-bishop. 20...Cxg7 21.Ce5 Ad6 The best try. White cannot be allowed to enter the position on the 7th  rank. 22.Cxd7 Ce6 [The ending after 22...Rxd7 23.Axg7 h5 24.Td5 Rc6 25.Rf1! also looks very promising for White. He has an active rook on the 5th  rank, a pawn majority that matters on the kingside, and Black has two weak and  split pawns there.] 23.Ce5 Axe5 24.Txd8+ Cxd8 25.Axe5 The ending looks  rather hopeless for Black, and in the game it was only moments before he lost  a pawn. 25...a5 26.Af6 Ce6 27.f4 a4 [27...Ta6 28.f5 Cd4 29.Axd4 Td6 30.c3 is also winning for White.

Black is struggling a little with the b4-pawn and his poorly-placed knight on a5. At the same time his only asset is the pressure from b7 towards e4, assisted by the knight on f6. There is only one way for him to exploit this - with tactics! 14...Cxe4! 15.Axe4 e6 Black will  regain the piece after which White has a weak pawn on d4 and Black has two  well-placed bishops. Nyzhnyk now chooses to accept the real pawn sacrifice  that Vovk's pseudo piece sacrifice involved. Although it feels very dangerous,  it is understandable that he chooses to do this rather than face the loss of a  pawn. 16.Axg6 hxg6 17.Cxb4 c5! Black would have decent compensation even  without this move, but it is a nice option to have. 18.Cbd3?! [18.Cbc2 was necessary, though obviously White's position is very unpleasant.] 18...cxd4 19.f4 e5 Black is clearly winning and clinched the full point on move  35. Line

White has a solid position, while Black is very active. If White had time to  consolidate his position, he would not have any problems. But at the moment  his hold on d4 is not so strong because of the X-ray attacks down the c- and  e-files. This is the only real weakness in the white position, and it can be  exploited tactically. 18...Axd4! 19.Txd4 [After 19.exd4? Ce6 the  d4-pawn would simply fall . The main tactical point is that the d4-pawn would  simply fall .

White's pawns on the queenside are quite impressive and might in the long term give him the chance to create a passed pawn. But more important is the weakness of the d6- and b6-squares and the pressure the b7-pawn can come under. 31.Cf5! [Less energetic play, such as 31.Db3 would allow Black to liquidate the pressure with 31...Cxe3 32.Dxe3 e5 33.Ce2 Txd2 34.Txd2 e4 35.Cc3 Axc3 36.Dxc3 e3 37.Te2 exf2+ 38.Rxf2 Txe2+ 39.Rxe2 Ad7 followed by ...♗c6, with an ending chat Black can hold without any great  problems.] 31...Cxe3?! This is a very natural move to play, but not a  fortunate one. [31...exf5 32.Txd5 Txd5 33.Txd5 to an obvious advantage  for White. But Black can fight on with 33...Txe3! 34.fxe3 Dxg3 35.Df2 Dc7 and  try to hold this position through dynamic defence. This looks pretty desperate,  but such is his position.] 32.Cxe3 Txd2 33.Txd2 Td8 [33...b6 34.c6 also  gives White a huge advantage.; 
Maybe it was best to get rid of the  c8-bishop with 33...Ad7 34.Cc4 Ac6 but White is still close to winning  after 35.Axc6 Dxc6 36.Dd1 when his control of the cl-file is excellent.; 
33...Ag5 34.f4 Ae7 does not really succeed in creating a weakness in the  white position. White would play 35.Cc4 with the threat of ♕e4 followed  by ♘b6xc8 and ♕xb7. Black is in considerable danger, for example: 35...Td8 36.Txd8+ Dxd8 37.Cb6 f5 38.Dc3 Af6 39.Df3 and Black's position is pretty  desperate.] 34.Cc4 Td4 [White also seems to be winning after 34...Ad7 35.Dd1!

The main point is of course that (38.Cd6 b6 might actually give Black real  drawing chances) 38...Ac6 39.Axc6 bxc6 40.Cc8! would lead to the win of  the c6-pawn.;

[Not a pleasant move to play, but Jobava  clearly did not like the alternative. Necessary was 18.Dxc5+ bxc5 19.Td1 to try to hold the position through passive defence. This is quite foreign to  Jobava, but none the less this was what he had to try. After 19...Axb2 20.0-0 White has big problems of course, but he will find the opposite-coloured  bishops a drawing factor, rather than a further pressure factor.

Coming from a modest variation of the Slav where White is aiming for a slight technical advantage, it is not always easy to create big problems for Black. Therefore it is necessary to create small but lasting problems! At this point White puts a bit of pressure on Black by forcing him to weaken his pawn structure a little, In the long term this is quite unpleasant, especially as the weakening is of the light squares, which Black must defend with a knight versus the white bishop. 18.Aa5! b6 19.Ad2 b5!? This creates a  further weakness in the black position, [I think 19...Dd7 was slightly  more accurate, White is still better after 20.Dc2! Tc8 21.Ac3 with a  long-term advantage, which is certainly assisted by the slight weakening of  the black queenside.] 20.Dc2 Th3?! [20...Db6 21.Tc1 Tc8 was the best  defence. White has various plans from this point and would have to choose. One  of these options is ♕c2-d1-e2 followed by e3-e4 or ♕g2 and playing on the  kingside. White is still to be preferred of course, but his advantage is not  too great yet.] 21.e4 dxe4 22.fxe4 Cg4 23.Ac1 Tdh8 24.e5 Ae7 25.Ae4 f5? This only loses time and creates weaknesses.

The weaknesses in the black position - the exposed nature of the e8-rook, the weakness of the light squares, such as f7, around the king, and the pressure on the c2-h7 diagonal - have quite a temporary nature. White has to react aggressively to ensure that these do not just disappear, for example after ...g6. 22.Axe5! Dxe5 23.Tfe1?! The second-best option , giving Black the chance to reach an endgame with a higher chance of survival than she deserves. [23.Td7! immediately was the best move. Black has virtually no choice, and after 23...Ac6 24.Df7+ Rh8 25.Txd8 Txd8 26.Dxa7 she would be facing a horrible uphill struggle. I guess that the reason Paehtz did not choose this line is that she saw the double threat 26...De2?! and simply stopped here.

The obvious weakness in the black position is the advanced b-pawn, which constitutes a hook. If we were looking at it solely from this point of view, we might be tempted to play 10.a4!?, which would give some advantage. But we should not forget that Black has neglected his development and thus exposed his king to a quick attack. Combining these two features gives White access to a powerful idea. Obviously many GMs will choose the right move quite quickly, simply because this kind of thinking is automatic in their heads, though it may not even be conscious. 10.c4! I believe that White is  already winning. 10...bxc4 The best chance. All the alternatives fail as well. [10...e5 11.dxe6 d5 is a strange idea. Black is playing for rapid  development. Unfortunately White is j ust winning after 12.exf7+ Dxf7 13.De2! preparing to escape to the queenside with the king.; 
10...Da5+ 11.Ad2 Db6 12.Cb3 bxc4 13.Axc4 is even worse. How is Black going to bring his  bishop out?; 
10...Cd7 11.cxb5 Da5+ 12.Ad2 Db6 also does not work. White  wins quickly after 13.Cc6 axb5 14.Ae3 Da6 15.a4 Axc6 16.dxc6 Dxc6 17.Tc1! Db7 18.Axb5 and Black should resign before he is humiliated any further.] 11.Da4+ Dd7 12.Dxc4 White's advantage is massive. Black cannot develop his  pieces in time. 12...g6 13.Ae2 h5?! [13...Ag7 was better, but White still has  a more or less winning advantage. A very plausible line would be 14.Ag4 Dd8 15.Tc1 0-0 when Black has very little chance of survival. White has many  options, for example: 16.Cc6 De8 17.Ca5 h5 18.Ad1 Ac8 19.b4 with an  overwhelming advantage.] 14.Ad1! Not the only strong move in the position,  but this decides the game at once. Black could have resigned here, but  struggled on to move 21. Line

White is trying to claim a slight edge by having a good knight on e4; he may later advance the h-pawn to create inconveniences on the kingside. Black decided to rid himself of his inferior bishop and open the inviting f-file with a small combination. 12...Cxe4! 13.fxe4 Dxg5! 14.Dxg5 Ah6 15.Dxh6 [You might wonder whether 15.Dd2 would be more precise, as the white king is probably better placed on d2 than c1.

In this position I find it attractive to try to activate the knight on h6, rather than advancing the g-pawn as Black did in the game.

24.b4! was in my opinion the best move. The pawn is fixed on b5 as a target and Black will have to remain passive in order to defend it. White will put a knight on d5 and manoeuvre the other knight around via e1- c2-e3 or similar, securing a close to decisive advantage.[24.Dd5 Txa1 25.Txa1 b4 also gives Black decent fighting chances, though White remains better after 26.c4; 
White's position is so fantastic that it might seem impossible to misplay it. Nevertheless, Karjakin's advantage reduces considerably over the next few moves. 24.Cd5 b4! Black should always play this move if possible. 25.Cd2 This shows that Karjakin was unhappy with his own play. (If he had intended to allow ...b4, then he would surely have prepared to answer it with 25.c4 which does seem better than the move played. But it is clear that Black's existence has been made just a little bit easier by weakening of the d4-square, as well as the fact that it is easier to defend the b-pawn. Black could even consider playing 25...b3!? making the position a little more double-edged. White is a good deal better, but he is not enjoying the level of control that he should have been.) 25...bxc3 26.bxc3 Txa1 27.Txa1 Despite the reduction in his advantage, White still managed to win the game on move 57.]  Line

White should be a little better on account of his freer play and the pressure down the d-file. The safest way to secure this edge is by taking into account Black's intentions.

The most important thing for Black to do in chis position is to get closer to completing his development. It is not always necessary to finish it at top speed, other thi ngs are important too, but you should at least leave flexibility to do so. The worst-placed piece is the knight on g8, as not only is it not caking part in the game, but it also prevents the king from getting to safety. The best square for this knight is f5 , from where it can both attack the centre and irritate the misplaced bishop on h4. 7...Ch6! This knight would have no function on the more "aesthetic" f6-square, bur  will be excellencly placed on f5 . When I have given this exercise to students  they have far too often (80%) chosen an active plan in the centre, for which  they were ill-prepared. The two standard ones are pushing the c- and e-pawns. [7...c5 is the lesser evil, as it does nor open the position fully. However,  Black's pieces are nor playing, and following 8.Ae2 I think White is in  general better mobilized. After 8...Cc6 (Thus the best move is: 8...Ch6 9.Db3!

White's pieces are not especially poorly placed, but if we look at them carefully, we can see that the queen is a bit uncomfortable in view of the possibility of ...d4. Obviously it has available squares and Aronian clearly was not worried about this. But once Anand made his move, the size of the problem became apparent. 16...Db8! This move has multiple functions.  Besides protecting the bishop it reduces the value of White's escape squares  for the queen. The threat of ...d4 is now very real. [A standard developing  move like 16...Tc8? would have led to a more or less equal game, but  would not be reacting to the positional factors of the position.] 17.Df4 [17.Ce2 d4 18.Df4 is no improvement.

In slow, closed positions like this, computers are of little help. The point here is chat with the centre almost hermetically sealed, all the play will happen on the kingside. Black is going to find himself in a minority there and should maybe have considered giving up the strong-looking but relatively ineffective bishop on a6 for the white knight. Instead White regroups it before going ahead with the planned kingside invasion. 20.Cg1! Cb8 Black plays like he has all the time in the world, but in reality he  needed to try to do something quickly, before White is too well organized. [20...Ac4 with the faint hope of provoking b2-b3 could be tried, but it is  not apparent what he should do after 21.Ta1 delaying the decision for later.] 21.g4 Cxe3 22.Dxe3 f5?!

28...Ae6! was the correct move. The bishop looks to support the b-pawn from a stable square and keeps an eye on the d-pawn at the same time. The threat to the d6-pawn is now very real. To be honest, nothing more is needed to make this decision, but it is nice to check a few lines anyway. [28...Ab3 is wholly unnatural and it is nor surprising that White has a simple way to an edge. Here both 29.Tc6 (and 29.Ad5! Axd5 30.Dxd5 are good, when Wh ite will win the b-pawn and hold on to the d-pawn. Winning will still not be trivial, but Black's defence will be very difficult.) ; 
28...b3? This is a horrible move, and it is difficult to understand how a player like lvanchuk can make it - even in a rapid game. The bishop is left entirely out of play with a naive dream of assisting the promotion of the b-pawn. As White is much more actively placed, this is unreal istic. White is now able to push his own pawn with the assistance of all his pieces. 29.Td1! Dd8 30.Da4! A nice move. The pawn will be pushed to d7. 30...Df6 31.Ad5?! (31.d7! Td8 32.Te1 would have won even more quickly. There are various mating ideas with ♖e8+ combined with ♕b4-f8 or ♗e4 and so on. Bue the move played in the game is clear enough as well.) 31...Dc3? (31...h5 32.d7 De7 33.Axb3 Axb3 34.Dxb3 h4 might have offered Black some chances of a draw, even if White is very close to winning.) 32.d7 Td8 33.Df4!

There are a few obvious features of this position - White is playing in the centre and on the queenside, whereas Black is aiming for a mating attack on the kingside, presumably by rolling the pawns fo rward. Because we have this contest between static play (slow pressure on the queenside and the hope of eliminating dynamics) and dynamic play (speed being of the essence in the attack , it is very important to take into account all aspects of the position, for example, the weakness of the e5-pawn and the need for White to reinforce his defence of the kingside with ♘bd2. Combining all of these factors, Kotronias came up with a good way to inject energy into the attack. 17...Cg5! [17...g5? looks natural , but does not take into  account the important features of the position. White plays 18.Ac3! with  the idea of ♘bd2-c4 (if allowed , when he hopes to tie White down before  playing ♖a6 and ♖fa1. If Black plays 18...g4 19.hxg4 Axg4 White has time for 20.Cbd2 with a very pleasant position. It will take Black quite some time to  create a real attack.] 18.Cxg5 Another advantage of Black's last move is  that White has no choice but to exchange the knights. Instead of being passive  on f7, the black knight has exchanged the only defender White has on the  kingside. 18...Dxg5 The threat to the h3-pawn wins another tempo. 19.Rh2 Tf6 True to his style, Kotronias plays very aggressively. [More moderate was 19...Tf7 with the idea of ...♖af8, ...♕h5 and ...g5-g4.] 20.Th1 It is  hard to say which is the best defensive try, but easy to determine that White  has to be very careful. [One lovely variation goes: 20.b5? Too  nonchalant; White deserves to get punished for this. 20...Dh4! 21.Dxe5 The  only critical try. 21...g5 Black is al ready threatening ...♗xh3 followed by ..  .♖h6. 22.Ac3 Tg6 23.Dc7 Tc8 24.De7 And now that the white queen can no  longer go to the g3-square, 24...f3 just wins.] 20...Dh5 21.f3 g5 22.Rg1 [Black's attack is very dangerous. For example, 22.Ac3 g4! 23.Axe5 gxf3 24.Axf6 fxg2 and mate is not far away: 25.Rxg2 De2+ 26.Rg1 f3] 22...Th6! Black prepares to open the g-file without allowing White to get the h1-rook  into the game. 23.Ae1 g4 24.fxg4 Axg4 25.Cd2 Af6! I like this  multi-purpose move more than the computer's preference, the committal 25 . . .  f3 , which leads to lots of complications and lots of chances to make mistakes.  From f6 the bishop is ready to go to h4 when needed and Black is one step  closer to putting the a8- rook on g8 . 26.Af2 Objectively a mistake, but  White's position is miserable. [Maybe a better chance was 26.Th2 Rh8 27.Cc4 though Black remains much better after 27...Ae6] 26...Rh8 27.Th2 Tg8 28.Rf1 Ae6? A very understandable mistake to make.

The opening has been just a modest success for White. He has gained the two bishops, but Black has a very powerful bishop on d4 and a solid pawn structure. Any advances have to be intremental and based on accuracy. The first thing to determine is that White should not go for any immediate action on the queenside with 18.cxb5. The second thing is to understand that exchanging the bishop on d4 too quickly would weaken the dark squares throughout the white position, and even though we do not anticipate the knight making it to d4, we could imagine having to exchange our good bishop for the knight, and maybe a black rook reaching d4 eventually. Black's only weakness is the b5-pawn (a hook) and the complex of pawn it fronts. The push a2-a4 will be in the air. Therefore the light-squared bishop belongs on b3, both because it is rather restrained where it is, and because we need this pawn push. But we also need to determine where the rooks belong. As the a1-square is unavailable, the only open line where we can imagine having any fun is the c-file. The d-file is blocked and falls under our opponent's influence. We have two rooks and they should be doubled where they can do some good. However, doubling the rooks immediately would block the transfer of the bishop to b3, so the correct move order is to improve the bishop first. 18.Ac2! [18.cxb5 cxb5 19.a4 bxa4 is too much too early. White can have an interesting equal  position after 20.b5 (or 20.Ac2 but he should not be tempted by tactics.; Black would win after 20.Axa6? Dxa6! 21.Dxa6 Txa6 22.Tc8+ Re7 23.Txh8 a3 24.Ae3 a2 25.Axd4 exd4 26.Ta1 Cxe4 and the forced sequence has  been bad for White indeed.

It is not a lot, but we have to make the most out of the  positions we land in and then take it from there.

It is rather obvious that the rooks are going to be exchanged in the very near future. After this we will have a scenario where White dominates the dark squares and Black the light squares. It is also clear that Black's king is more exposed and that a draw would be a satisfying result for Black. For this reason, White needs to think about his own king's protection, not from mate, but from perpetual check. The only place the king can hide is on h2, so this determines the recapture. 25.fxg3! This is the most dangerous  approach. Black should be able to hold the game without too much trouble, but  it requires some accuracy and as we shall see, this is not something that even  such a great player as Mikhail Tal could manage over the board. [After  thinking about the probability of a perpetual check, it is useless to  contemplate taking with the h-pawn. But it is worth having a quick look at the  consequences of 25.Txd5!? Axh2+ 26.Rxh2 cxd5 27.Da4 when White will win  the pawn back shortly. But the problem is that after the exchange of pawns,  the draw is closer and the white king is a bit less safe than in the game. I  do not believe that the draw is too far away. 27...b6 28.Dd4 h5 29.Dxd5+ Rh7 I  find it difficult to imagine that White would be able to overcome a reasonably  played black defence.] 25...Txd1+ 26.Dxd1 Dd7 27.De1 Ae6 The first  inaccuracy I could detect. Tal is trying to be active on the queenside where  he has a majority, but passive defence would have a far greater chance of  success. [The best move was 27...Dd6! This anticipates White's plan of  h3 and ♔h2, and also prevents the white bishop from appearing on e5 too soon.  After 28.h3 h5 there is no reason to believe chat Black would not be able  to conduct a successful defence.] 28.b3 c5 I also do not like this move  much. Black is being too active, when passive defence would be more  appropriate. The main problem with this move is that it weakens the b5-square,  which results in an entry point into the black position. [28...Dd3 29.h3 would also lead to an advantage for White. You could imagine a line like 29...b6 30.Ae5 h5 31.Df2 Af5 32.Df4 with some advantage.] 29.h3 b5? This is  too optimistic. [29...h5 also fails to work, for very similar reasons to  the game continuation: 30.Df1! Df7 31.Db5! and Black is under a lot of  pressure. There are too many weaknesses in the black position for it to be  anything bur seriously unpleasant.; 
The best defence was probably 29...Dd3 30.Ae5 h5 though White has a long-term edge.] 30.Df1! White is probably  winning now. The queen will penetrate the position , and Black is suffering  from the weaknesses he has inflicted on himself. 30...b4 31.Ae5 Dd8 [31...De7 32.Db5 Rf7 would offer a bit more resistance, but after 33.Db8 Black is still  in serious trouble.] 32.Db5!

This position is rather simple; Black needs to get the bishop on c8 into the game quickly so he can enjoy his bishop pair. In order to do this he needs to get the knight out of the way. But obviously he should not just mechanically put it on f6, where it would be going nowhere. 15...Cb8! [The other option was 15...Td8 to play ...♘d7-f8-e6, but this has two  minor downsides - it is a bit slower and the knight could easily be in the way  of the c8-bishop again. Sure, you can bring the bishop out first, but this  would decrease Black's flexibility. From c6 the knight will shoot instantly at  d4, causing White to have serious concerns straight away.] 16.Ce5!? A  radical move, following which it will be very difficult to hang on to the pawn,  but what else should White play?

This looks like a typical Sicilian position, but in this case White has a strong unconventional option. 12.Db6! A devastating move for  Black. Once the queens are exchanged, Black is left with passive pieces and  problems defending the d6-pawn . [12.e5!? is also interesting, but  ultimately leads to a defendable position for Black: 12...dxe5 13.Dxe5 Ab4 14.Dxa5 Axa5 15.Ad4 (15.Af3 Axc3 16.bxc3 Cd5! is okay for Black. He can  hold the opposite-coloured bishop ending.) 15...Axc3 16.Axc3 Cd5 17.Ad2 b5 White is a bit better, but I would not feel that I was in desperate trouble  if I was Black here.] 12...Dxb6 13.Axb6 White's advantage is considerable  as Black cannot become active.

Kamsky is one of the great defenders of our time, but his  position is horrible. [13...Ad7 is answered strongly with: 14.e5 dxe5 (14...Ce8 15.Ac5! and wins) 15.fxe5 Cd5 16.Cxd5 exd5 17.Af3;

White has an excellent position with complete control, but in order to improve it, he needs to make the most of all of his pieces. At this point, White's least active piece is the bishop on g2, which is staring straight at the immobile pawn on e4. Korchnoi wanted more from the bishop and created a new diagonal for it. 23.h4! The bishop prepares to come to h3  and put the black centre under pressure. 23...Af8 [It is quite possible that  Black would have been better off trying to change the symmetrical structure in  the centre with 23...Cd4 24.Cxd4 exd4 although White would have the option  of playing 25.f4! with control over all the important squares. He would  probably follow up with ♔h2, ♕f2, ♖d2 and similar moves that simply  improve the position without committing to a specific action.] 24.Ah3 Db8 25.Rh2 Ac8 It is clear that White has improved his position, albeit only  slightly. Now he redirects his bishop to e3, overprotecting the pawn on c5 and  freeing the knight to go to a5. 26.Ad2 Ab7 27.Ae3 Dc7 28.Dc3! keeping  the a5-square under control. 28...Tad8 29.f3 Ta8 Black is playing without a plan.

White has no advantage to speak of on the queenside; nor does he have any real chance to develop one against decent play. However, it is possible to develop an attack on the kingside where both of White's minor pieces can attack, while the knight on c5 will find it difficult to join the defence. At the same time it will be easier for White to activate his rooks. 22.g4! Banishing the queen from its active post. 22...Dc8 [22...Df6 23.g5! would force the black queen back to g7 or h8, where it would be in the way  rather than helping with the defence, as after 23...Df5? 24.Ag4 De4 25.f3 it  is trapped.] 23.Rg2 Ag7 24.Th1 Cd7 25.hxg6 hxg6 26.Th4 a4 Black is  arriving way too late. 27.Tbh1 axb3 28.axb3 Ta1 29.T1h3 Da8 30.Th7 White  has prepared his attack as well as could be expected. 30...Da2 [30...Ta2 31.Dd1 does not help greacly; ♕h1 is threatened, and after 31...Ta1 32.Ad4!

There do not seem to be any real weaknesses in either side's position, with the exception of the d4-pawn, which is a target only because White has fallen a little behind in development.

The following sacrifice should be automatic for everyone, as I am sure it was for Stellwagen. Not because the bishop on d8 is a great piece, but because of the resulting pin of the f6-knight and the way the knight on c3 and the rook on e1 can put pressure on the black position. 18.Txd8!

The only defence was 19...Rf8 when both 20.Txe5 (and 20.Td1 gives White an edge, although it is not yet conclusive.

Black has a potentially good square on d5, but at the moment White would be able to kick the knight away with c2-c4 . As there are few things as wonderful as a stable knight in the centre, Black's next move is almost automatic; I seriously doubt that Portisch hesitated before playing it. 17...c4! 18.Ce5 [It is not entirely without value to spend a  tempo provoking a weakness with 18.Aa5 though unlike elsewhere in this book,  the weakening of the c6-square after 18...b6 is not so critical here. White no  longer has his light-squared bishop and Black does not have any problems  protecting the light squares in the short term. He might have some problems  securing his king in the long term, but at the moment this would not extend to  much more than a minor annoyance.] 18...Tc8!

White's worst-placed piece is beyond doubt the knight on a4, while the black knight on d5 is sensational . Exchanging the two makes perfect sense. 18.c4! bxc3 [18...Dxc4? 19.Tc1] 19.Cxc3 Cxc3+ 20.Axc3 White's  pieces gravitate to great squares with tempo. 20...Ae7 21.Cd4?!

I expect that Adams was unsure about 26...Tc3 (26...Ab7 27.bxc4 Axc6 28.Axc6 Dxc6 29.Dd4 on the other hand probably  did not worry him.) 27.Tc1 Txc1+ 28.Txc1 Da3 but after 29.Db4 this  results in a favourable endgame for White, very much to his taste.] 26...Ta4 27.Ac6?! This leads to a position which I feel does not favour White much. [27.The1! would have tried to take advantage of the passivity of the black  position. But there are still a lot of details to take care of. 27...Db6! (27...Cd5 28.f5) 28.Dd6 Tb4 29.Dxb6 Txb6 30.Cc4 Tb4 31.Cd6 I should think  Adams would have been happy enough with this endgame.; 
27.Dd6! looks  best though. After 27...Dxd6 28.Txd6 Ce4 29.Axe4 Txe4 30.Tc1 White has a fine  game. For example: 30...f6 31.Cc6 Ab7 32.Ce7+ Rh8 33.Tb6 Aa8 34.Txa6 e5 35.fxe5 Txe5 36.Ta7 and it is hard for Black to justify his pawn "sacrifice"] 27...Tb4 28.Cd3 Txb2+ 29.Dxb2 Dxc6 30.Ce5 Da8 31.Ra1!

Although this does not lose all the advantage, it is decidedly inferior to the direct win with 22.g4! This has the simple idea [The two most important aspects of this position are the weakness of the d6-pawn and the poorly-placed knight on f5. Bu tried to trap the knight, but went completely astray, only winning the game due to a blunder by his opponent. I believe that he did not fully appreciate how weak d6 really is. 22.dxc6? bxc6 23.g4! Belated, but not too late to be effective. The knight is after all trapped. 23...d5 (After 23...Txb2 24.gxf5 Axf5 25.Te2 White is a piece up, though there are still some complications remaining.) 24.cxd5? This is truly feeble; Bu misses another great option. (Here White could have invaded his opponent's position with 24.Te6! leading to all kinds of threats. The forced line goes: 24...Cd4 25.Txg6 Txf4 26.Cxd4! and Black cannot recapture on d4 because of 27.♕e5!, but has to play 26...Txf1+ when after 27.Axf1 the only move that keeps the game going is 27...Df8! Here White has many tempting options, all leading to good winning chances. But after 15 minutes of probing, I still have not found a knock-out blow. Black seems to have many defensive resources. I allowed Fritz 12 to speculate for a while; every minute it decided on another favourite, always claiming an advantage, but not a win, for White.) 24...cxd5 25.Ta4?! (White is drifting badly. It was better to retreat with 25.Te2 when after 25...Cd4 26.Cxd4 Axd4+ 27.Ae3 the position is quite equal. A possible tactical end to the game would be: 27...Axe3+ 28.Txe3 Txf1+ 29.Dxf1 Txb2 30.Axd5+ Dxd5 31.Te8+ Rg7 32.Te7+ Rg8 and so on.) 25...Te8 26.Dc1 (White is also a little worse after 26.Da5 Dxa5 27.Txa5 Tb4! 28.gxf5 Txf4 29.fxg6 Ab7 when Black's bishops have come to life.) 26...Txb2? A completely needless sacrifice. (After the simple 26...Db6+ 27.Rh1 Ce3 Black was simply a little better. I am not sure why Friso refrained from this pleasant option. It could be that he did not fully feel in control of the position after 28.Axb8 but Black plays 28...Cxf1 29.Axf1 Dxb8 with an edge, and ideas such as 30.Dc6 Ab7! 31.Dxg6 d4 when White would be subjected to a fierce attack.) 27.gxf5 Axf5 28.Cd4 White has many other options, but I am not sure if any are better. 28...Dd7?? A horrible move that is hard to explain. Black had several alternatives that would have kept him in the game. a) 28...Db6 is playable, though it does not solve all Black's problems: 29.Axd5+ (29.Ae3 Ad3! equalizes) 29...Rh7 30.Dc7 Dxc7 31.Axc7 Ae4! 32.Te1! Black cannot fully equalize, but after both 32...Tg2+ (and 32...Axd4+ 33.Txd4 Tg2+ 34.Rh1 Te2+ 35.Txe4 T8xe4 36.Txe2 Txe2 Black has respectable drawing chances. I would personally hope to draw these endings about 80% of the time.) 33.Rf1 Tf8+ 34.Cf3 Axd5 35.Rxg2 Txf3 36.Rg1; b) The best option is the speculative sacrifice 28...Txg2+ 29.Rxg2 Axd4 30.Txd4 Dxh4 giving Black a lot of threats. I do not think White can gain a substantial advantage. For example: 31.Tf2 (Or 31.Dc3! Ah3+!? (31...g5 32.Ag3 Ae4+ 33.Txe4 Dxe4+ 34.Rh2 Tf8 is another good drawing chance. Whi te should probably keep the rooks on and try to deliver mate, but it will not be so easy.) 32.Dxh3 Te2+ 33.Rf3 Dxh3+ 34.Rxe2 g5 and the pawns are probably strong enough to generate sufficient counterplay.) 31...Dg4+ 32.Rf1 g5! and a drawable ending is in the cards.; 29.Cxf5 White is winning. 29...Dxa4?! (29...Tee2 30.Af3 Dxa4 may have been Black's intended idea, but White plays 31.Cxg7! and Black does not have an attack without the all-important bishop.) 30.Cxg7 Dd4+ 31.Rh1 Txg2 32.Cxe8 Te2 33.Db1] 22...Cd4 [but after 22...b5! 23.gxf5 Axf5 White will play 24.Te6! and Black is simply a piece down.

For this reason, Rowson decided to fully establish control over the d4-square. 19...c5! 20.b5 [20.bxc5 may have  been better, but 20...Txd1+ 21.Txd1 Cxc5= would give Black other advantages   (the split white pawns), as a substitute for not getting the d4-square.] 20...Txd1+ 21.Txd1 Cd4 [21...axb5? 22.cxb5 Re7 23.a4 Cf7 would be sharper.  White obtains the c4-square, but has no target on a6 to play against. My  engine prefers Black, but I really think the position is satisfactory for  White.] 22.Axd4? A horrible move. After this White has no play and Black  is well placed on the dark squares. [Correct was 22.Cxd4 when the safest  reply is 22...exd4= (but where Rowson undoubtedly would have gone for 22...cxd4!? 23.Ad2 Re6 (23...Txc4 24.Af1 gives White excellent counterplay.  The only winning chance for Black is 24...axb5!?

Black is better, but White should manage to hold the position  with active play.] 23...axb5 24.cxb5 Ab4 25.Ce1 Axe1 Avoiding any  opposite-coloured bishop endings, just in case. 26.Txe1 Re6 Black has some  advantage, but accurate play might still have saved the day. 27.a4 b6 28.a5 bxa5 29.Ta1 Cf7 30.Txa5 Cd6 31.Ta6 Tc3 32.b6? This pawn now becomes a  liability rather than an asset.

The weaknesses in the white camp are f4 and f2 (and to some extent also g4) . In the black camp the weakness is g7.

17...Cc6! was the correct response. The main line goes [Black is under some pressure down the d-file and it would be quite natural to look mainly at defensive ideas. But if we do our threepoint analysis we notice that there is indeed a weakness of importance in the white position and that our worst-placed piece can attack it in only two moves. Had Werle thought in terms of the three questions, he would probably have drawn this game quite easily. Instead he swam like an axe, to use a Russian idiom. 17...Cd7? 18.e5! The decisive break, taking advantage of the lack of stability in the black pawn structure. Black's response is forced. 18...Cxe5 19.Cxe5 Axg2 20.Rxg2 dxe5 21.Txd8 Txd8 (21...Axd8 might have given a few more practical chances, but White's pawn majority on the queenside would still give him a solid edge.) 22.Txd8 Axd8 23.Axc5 a5 I would probably have tried 23...a6, not allowing White to undouble his pawns so easily, but the position would still be very difficult. 24.b4 axb4 25.Axb4 f5 26.c5 Rf7 27.c6 e4 28.Cb5 Ab6?! (Black should have tried 28...Ae7 29.Aa5 Af6 as a last practical chance. The ending arising after 30.c7 where Black has two pawns for the knight, is of course winning for White; but he would have to prove this in practice.) 29.Ad6] 18.e5 [White can also try 18.h4 but it does not make any difference, Black will respond with the same idea of 18...Ca5 with sufficient counterplay.] 18...Ca5! with counterplay. In my option White does not have any advantage here. He has a few options, but really what we need to play like this with Black is only to check the absolutely concrete stuff: 19.exd6 Cxd6 20.Axc5 Cxb3 21.Axd6 Cxd2 These kinds of desperado moves where you have to make the right captures with the right pieces can be a bit confusing, but here it works out beautifully. 22.Axe7 [22.Cxd2?

24.Ce4! was the perfect way to take advantage of Black's problems; g2-g4 is now a huge threat. Black's only attempt to obtain play is to go through with her plan with [White would love to push it with g2-g4, but at the moment Black can meet 24.g4? with 24...Dxb2 25.Ce4 Cf4! when she would have the advantage. White's job is thus to prepare for this tactic - this can be by preventing it or through having a way to deal with it when it comes.; 
An interesting move is 24.b3!? simply preventing ...♕xb2. White should certainly have the advantage after this. But there is an even stronger way to deal with it, taking advantage of the weakness of the d6-pawn as well.; 
The most important factor in the position is the badly-placed knight on h5. 24.Ta3? This move makes little sense beyond trapping the queen if it takes on b2. Black novy has time to activate her queen. 24...Db4! 25.Tb3 (25.g4 can be met with either 25...Dd4! where Black is probably a bit better,(or with 25...Cf4 26.Dxf4 Dxb2 27.Dc1 Cf3+ and the position is wildly unclear, with about even chances.) ) 25...Dd4 Black has overcome her immediate problems with the knight and is now a little better.

Black's weakness is the king. The weakest squares in his position are e6 and e8. lt is too easy to get deluded into thinking that the pin is important, when in face Black is very well placed to deal with it. For this reason, the worst-placed white piece is ironically the rook, which would be much better checkmating the black king, rather than hitting its head against a brick wall. 35.Te1!

There are a few weaknesses in the white position - the a4-pawn, the d4-square, the f2- pawn and maybe even the d3-pawn, though it is hard to see how Black will be able to attack it at the moment.

Using the attack on  the a-pawn as a way to gain time. 28.Da1?! [28.h4! would have been a  very interesting defensive attempt. The main point is that White has some play  on the light squares after 28...Axa4 29.Da2 Axb3 30.Dxb3 though Black remains  better with 30...Ac5] 28...Ad7!

It is not clear at first glance how to judge Black's unusual set-up with the pawn on h3 and knight on g2 - is it an effective invasion of the white position, or is the knight misplaced? This is a common phenomenon in modern chess. Being able to evaluate which factor is the most important is what many games are all about. Having said this, usually it is possible to cut complicated positional questions down to some simple basics. The white knight on d1 and the rook on f1 are poor. The knight on g2 may be good or bad, depending on circumstances. The f3-square is weak. The pawn on e6 is exposed. Black is able to solve all of these issues with a simple stroke. 25...e5!! 26.dxe5 [White has no real alternatives. 26.Dxe5 Te8 followed by 27...♕f3 wins quickly.;
